<p>A <em>proof of space</em> is a proof that a farmer has allocated a portion of their storage in a way that is very difficult to create in real-time but efficient to pre-compute and store on a hard drive. The <a href="https://www.chia.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Chia_Proof_of_Space_Construction_v1.1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chia Proof of Space Construction document</a> goes deeply into the math and implementation considerations to mitigate <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f0ba/66072ac10d9898b8a79171ec726d45ec804b.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hellman&#x27;s Time - Memory tradeoff</a> problem. A plot is a large set of proofs of space. A harvester can harvest multiple plots on the same machine. A farmer can then control <a href="/zh-Hans/farming-on-many-machines/">multiple harvesters across many machines</a> to manage the whole &quot;farm&quot;.</p>
<p>Farming uses substantially less electricity than Proof of Work for the same unit of security. You can learn more at <a href="https://chiapower.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chiapower.org</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-vdfproof-of-time">What is a VDF/proof of time?<a href="#what-is-a-vdfproof-of-time" class="hash-link" aria-label="What is a VDF/proof of time?的直接链接" title="What is a VDF/proof of time?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>A VDF, also known as a proof of time, is a sequential operation that takes a prescribed amount of time to compute (and which cannot be accelerated by parallelism) and which produces an accompanying proof whose result may be quickly verified. This must be done in a group, for which Chia uses ideal class groups. You can learn about them in our <a href="https://github.com/Chia-Network/oldvdf-competition/blob/master/classgroups.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">class group document</a>. <a href="/zh-Hans/timelord-algorithm/">Timelords</a> usually run three VDFs at a time for the three internal blockchains of the Chia blockchain. They run as <code>vdf_client</code> processes.</p>

<p>A genesis challenge is the first VDF challenge on a network that uses the Proof of Space and Time consensus. For more info about the genesis challenge for Chia&#x27;s mainnet, see the <a href="/zh-Hans/consensus-challenges/#genesis-challenge">consensus section</a> of this website.

<p>XCH is the currency symbol for Chia. TXCH is the currency symbol currently being used for testnet chias. TXCH has no value and is only used for testing purposes. Chias and testnet chias can be divided up to 12 decimal places (trillionths). The smallest unit of chia, a trillionth of a chia, is called a mojo, as a tribute to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnet_(peer-to-peer_network)#Evil_Geniuses_for_a_Better_Tomorrow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mojo Nation</a>, a decentralized file storage platform created in the early 2000s by Zooko Wilcox, Bram Cohen, and others.</p>

<p>Chia, like all companies, has an obligation to protect and enforce its Trademarks and Copyrights in the relevant jurisdictions. We do this both to ensure that we properly maintain our own responsible use of them, as well as to prevent bad actors from attempting to leverage Chia’s property in an effort to scam the ecosystem or cause other harm. That said, we do want to make it possible for people to talk about Chia, and build tools and platforms that support it’s growth openly. To this effect we have <a href="https://www.chia.net/about#legal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several guidelines</a> that we hope will help you better understand some “Do’s and Don’ts” as you go about this.

<p>Our hope is that, over time, Chia will be supported by point of sale systems and consumer payment apps all over the world.

<p>We’re green money! Our founder Bram Cohen started the company knowing he wanted to reduce the energy dependence of blockchains through a “green” option. The concept of farming seemed to be the best metaphor for filling unused disk space and monitoring it for winning sprouts. This led us to look for a grain that had the properties we wanted to embody with our new Network. The team wanted a name that would be short and impactful. Everyone was amused that it was also a grain associated with a whimsical meme. Chia Network was born.</p>

<p>We believe that Chia coins will be less volatile than other cryptocurrencies due to the planned nature of our planned public company status which will allow financial institutions to hedge and leverage coins and equity. Initially, we expect Chia Network to largely be valued based upon the valuation of the chia that the Company will hold on its balance sheet. Movements in the price of chia on digital exchanges are likely to be mirrored by price movements in the price of our stock on a stock exchange. There will be more ways to get exposure to the success of chia than traditional blockchain projects. This will also allow the usual options and derivatives to our stock to be used as something like a synthetic derivative for the price of chia coins. Additionally, our ability to use the Chia Strategic Reserve may reduce some volatility of chia in the market.</p>

<p>Chia has a novel business model to both, lower volatility of the coin and increase adoption. By loaning Chia and managing the interest rates of those loans as well as other tools like buying our stock with chia coins, we hope to lower the quarter to quarter volatility of the coin. To drive adoption, we intend to loan Chia to Global 5000 companies who will use it to pay their international vendors quickly, less expensively, and more securely. We also intend to use the strategic reserve to aid development and adoption. We plan to do things like invest in promising startups in the Chia ecosystem, potentially increase farming rewards during limited periods of time to spur additional farming, and fund corporations paying 105% of the value of their international payables in Chia instead of fiat currency.</p>
<p>Chia Network Inc created 21 million chia at mainnet launch. This is known as the Strategic Reserve.

<p>You can farm Chia on the unused storage of your laptop, desktop, or corporate network and, in return, you have the chance to receive rewards in chia for helping secure the blockchain. Our software allows you to allocate a certain amount of unused disk space to create plots. Since the only resource intensive step is the initial plotting, once you download the Chia node software, your drives will be plotted in the background. Once plotting is complete, your computer will begin farming on your behalf and the software does all the work and tracks your rewards for you. Ongoing farming uses very little network bandwidth and almost no resources other than storage. By making the farming process available to anyone with unused disk space, we are moving towards our goal of a truly decentralized blockchain that will also serve as a cross subsidy to the storage and cloud industry.

<p>It is our belief that the blockchain industry is still led by developers. We intend to be the superior chain for deploying new applications and services as well as being the only serious and secure choice for applications like sovereign backed stable coins. The Chia Network business will be the first for profit company that manages a pre-farm and we intend to be the first publicly tradable “near ETF” cryptocurrency. We believe that - as Redhat and MySQL AB were necessary to drive corporate adoption of linux and mysql - we will be the source for support and training as sovereigns, financial institutions, and corporations look to use cryptocurrency in daily commerce. Finally, we believe that we will be able to leverage the storage ecosystem to drive adoption at corporations and end users as hard drive manufacturers and storage server sellers are likely to bundle space farming into their offerings.</p>

<p>Mining requires expensive single use hardware that consumes exorbitant amounts of electricity. We are mitigating this problem through a fair, eco-friendly, and better blockchain that uses farming to leverage existing empty hard disk space distributed on nodes around the globe. Farming remains decentralized because anyone that has installed our software and has plots can win the next block. Mining requires expensive custom single use hardware and access to electricity at wholesale or better prices which only purpose built corporations can afford to mine. Farming is more decentralized because it relies on empty hard disk space and anyone with a mobile phone, laptop, or corporate network tends to have extra space not currently being used. Unlike mining, once you’re done farming your storage you can repurpose it to, for example, store your family photos.</p>

<p>Proof of space can be thought of as a way to prove that you are keeping some storage unused on your hard-disk drive. Users of the Chia blockchain will “seed” unused space on their hard-disk drive by installing software which stores a collection of cryptographic numbers on the disk into “plots.” These users are called “farmers.” When the blockchain broadcasts a challenge for the next block, farmers can scan their plots to see if they have the hash that is closest to the challenge. A farmer’s probability of winning a block is the percentage of the total space that a farmer has compared to the entire network.</p>
<p>Proof of time requires a small period of time to pass between blocks. Proof of time is implemented by a Verifiable Delay Function that takes a certain amount of time to compute, but is very fast to verify. The key idea of a VDF is that they require sequential computation, and since having many parallel machines does not yield any benefit, electricity waste is minimized. There will likely be relatively few VDF servers (“Timelords”), as the fastest one will always finish first and it takes only one fast and fair Timelord on the network to complete a block and move the chain forward.</p>

Chia is the first enterprise-grade digital money. Chia was incorporated in August of 2017 to develop an improved blockchain and smart transaction platform. We are building the Chia Network to improve the global financial and payments systems. Chia is the first enterprise-grade digital money. Chia is using the first new Nakamoto consensus algorithm since Bitcoin. Called Proof of Space and Time, it was created by Bram Cohen, the best network protocol engineer alive and the inventor of BitTorrent. Chialisp is Chia’s new smart transaction programming language that is powerful, easy to audit, and secure. Reference smart transactions currently available are: atomic swaps, authorized payees, recoverable wallets, multisig wallets, and rate-limited wallets.

<p>What makes Chia different from proof of work blockchains?</p>
<p>One core difference is the consensus algorithm called proof of space and proof of time. One core difference is the consensus algorithm called proof of space and proof of time. Basically as after the farmer creates a proof of space and a block, other computers called timelords add proofs of time to the block, which is a cryptographic proof that says that a certain amount of time (like 30 seconds) has passed. So instead of the whole world mining at the same time, only a few computers are &quot;mining&quot; for each proof of space that won. Since these are all cryptographic proofs, they cannot be forged or broken, making the consensus extremely secure.

Since these are all cryptographic proofs, they cannot be forged or broken, making the consensus extremely secure.</p>
<p>In Chia, the only electricity required is the electricity to create the plots, and to run the hard drives, which is on the order of 10 watts to power, plus CPU power required to run a full node (which is very light). In comparison Blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on huge farms of GPUs ( 300W each GPU), or ASICs (hundreds or thousands of watts per machine) to secure the blockchain. You can think of proof of work, as millions of computers &quot;making&quot; lottery tickets by using electricity, but each ticket can only be used once. Chia will use vastly less electricity as each plot will last over 5 years, and the only electricity required is the initial setup (plotting) and 10W for farming a drive.</p>

<p>&quot;k&quot; is the space parameter that controls the size of plots. It is an integer for the following equation: <code>plot_size_bytes = C1 * 2^k(k + C2)</code> where C1 is constant 1 and C2 is constant 2. In practice this means that final size is roughly <code>((2 * k) + 1) * (2 ** (k - 1)) * 0.78005</code> though that constant is estimated.

<p>You can see some example plot sizes, times to plot, and working space needed based on various k&#x27;s in these <a href="/zh-Hans/k-sizes/">k size tables</a>. Current working space needed for the default plotting options of a k=32 is 239 GiB and the final file is approximately 101.4 GiB. There is small natural variation in temp space needed and the final file size of each plot. Note that 239 GiB is 256.6 GB.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-k-size-should-you-plot">What k-size should you plot?<a href="#what-k-size-should-you-plot" class="hash-link" aria-label="What k-size should you plot?的直接链接" title="What k-size should you plot?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>The minimum plot size is k=32. There is only one reason why you might want to plot larger than k=32: to maximize the total utilization of a given drive or space. A couple of k=33 plots with a majority of k=32 plots can reduce the amount of leftover unused space on a drive.</p>
<p>The reason k=32 was chosen as the minimum plot size was to prevent a short-range replotting attack, which is detailed in our <a href="/zh-Hans/consensus-intro/">consensus doc</a>. The gist of the attack is that if someone can create a plot in less than ~30 seconds, they could create a new plot that passes the filter for each signage point, and then delete the new plot immediately afterward. This would effectively emulate storing 512 plots, thus turning Chia into PoW.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that this attack does not create a winning plot; it only creates a plot that passes the filter.</li>
</ul>
<p>This attack won&#x27;t be economically feasible for some time, if ever. Two potential mitigation techniques are to lower the plot filter (thus reducing the benefit of the attack), or to increase the minimum plot size (thus making the attack more difficult to perform).</p>
<p>k=32 is expected to be the minimum plot size until at least 2026. If and when that size is increased, you will be given ample notice to replot before the change is made effective.</p>

<p>We think you will want to use used Data Center grade NVMe SSD drives to create your plots. Regular consumer NVMe SSD generally has too low of a <a href="https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/storage-hardware/ssd-lifespan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TBW</a> rating. One of our community members keeps this handy <a href="/zh-Hans/ssd-endurance/">SSD Endurance page</a> up to date so you can compare various SSDs. You should never use your root/OS SSD to plot as it can lead to drive failure and loss of booting. You can plot directly to hard drives and get good results, especially if you plot in parallel to different drives. You can use non-root SSD over Thunderbolt 3 and migrate your plots off to whatever storage you want to keep them on long term. You could even load them on a Raspberry Pi 4 with outdated USB 2.0 drives attached and they will harvest and farm just fine. PC World offers this great <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2899351/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nvme.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">background on current storage technologies</a> but this graph gives you a quick view of why we recommend NVMe SSD: <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="NVMe SSD vs SATA" src="/zh-Hans/assets/images/plotting-nvme-ssd-3e96a2dbbf6a2b44bbfa758c012efc82.png" title="NVMe SSD is 5.5 times faster than SATA SSD" width="1792" height="1140" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Yes, using either the GUI or CLI. Over the short run you have a bit more control of plotting using the CLI. You can read the <a href="/zh-Hans/installation/">Installation page</a> to learn more. You may have better results if you stagger the start time of parallel plotting processes depending on your hardware setup.</p>

<p>是的。 The <a href="/zh-Hans/moving-plots/">Moving Plots page</a> gives you the details. You may also want to consider running a <a href="/zh-Hans/farming-on-many-machines/">remote harvester</a>. You can also use the same private key set to plot on more than one machine at a time but be aware of the <a href="/zh-Hans/faq/#why-should-i-not-run-more-than-one-node-on-a-home-network-and-whats-this-about-upnp">uPnP issues</a>.</p>

<p><code>-2</code> is in use during phase 3 and 4. It is the file being built into the resulting .plot file. As it is done compressing tables during phase 3, it will move them into the <code>.plot.2.tmp</code> file (<code>-2</code>), and phase 4 will scan through the entire <code>.plot.2.tmp</code> (<code>-2</code>) file, and write table headers for easy access by the harvester. When phase 4 is done, if <code>-2</code> = <code>-d</code>, it will simply rename the <code>.plot.2.tmp</code> to <code>.plot</code>. If <code>-2</code> != <code>-d</code>, it will copy the file into place, then rename, and finally remove the <code>-2</code> file. The amount of writing is about 110% of the resulting <code>.plot</code> file size. It is a setup dependent option - is your setup faster at moving the compressed tables into the <code>.plot.2.tmp</code> file, and then scan through the entire file, and write table headers during phase 4 - and then copy to <code>-d</code> (<code>-2</code> = <code>-t</code>) - or is it faster to send the compressed tables directly into the <code>-d</code> (<code>-2</code> = <code>-d</code>) directory, and then in phase 4, scan through the entire file, and write table headers inside <code>-d</code> (<code>-2</code> = <code>-d</code>) thereby skipping the final copy into place. The <code>-2</code> directory can be set in the Advanced Options for Step 3 in the GUI.</p>

<p>If you see something like <code>Caught plotting error: Not enough memory for sort in memory. Need to sort X.XXGiB</code> then you need to either select more memory buffer or more buckets.

<p>This is a RAM problem with your machine. It can be how your swap file is configured. It is often your overclock, or XMP settings and even can be a faulty RAM stick. Chia plotting is better than memtest at surfacing broken or mis-configured RAM.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, resuming a plot is not supported. We suggest that you disable power saving mode - especially for external drives - and try to limit other possible causes of interruptions. Plotting a k=32 could take multiple hours, depending on your hardware, so these interruptions can be painful. They are also a part of why we don&#x27;t recommend plotting plots larger than k=32 as each increment in k generally doubles the time to complete a single plot.</p>

<p>No. Plotting can be done entirely offline and needs nothing from the blockchain to complete. The only time you have to be online and synced is when you&#x27;re farming so that you receive new challenges for the next blocks and transactions to include in a transaction block if you&#x27;re lucky enough to win one of them and get the transaction fees. Note that one farmer winning is independent of other farmers winning at the same time. All farmers can &quot;win&quot; at nearly the same time. That is why sometimes there are 10 blocks in one minute, and sometimes there is only 1 block per minute, etc.</p>

<p>No. As long as you plot at least k=32, those plots will be eligible to win on mainnet. In a decade or more, k=32 may become too small, but that&#x27;s speculative. Usually the only reason to plot larger than k=32 is to optimize using all of the space on a given drive. For example, it may make sense to have two k=33&#x27;s and the rest k=32 so that you only leave 10 GB free on a given drive.</p>

<p>Run <code>chia plots check -n 30</code> to try 30 sample challenges for each plot. Each of your plots should return a number around 30, which means it found around 100% of the attempted proofs of space. If you&#x27;re still worried try <code>-n 100</code> as more random attempts will give you a more valid assessment that the plots is fine. It really is ok if your plot is within 80%-120%. If some of your plots are missing for some reason you may need to add the directory they are in to your config.yaml file. That can be done in the GUI with the MANAGE PLOT DIRECTORIES button or on the command line with <code>chia plots add -d [directory]</code>.</p>

<p>On Windows, it has not worked well since the communication speed is not fast enough, sometimes the usb turns off, then the plot is not valid. It&#x27;s possible to run 1 plot, but limiting when trying to process multiple plots. Most are installing PCIe adapters to SSC/NVME and that solves the issue. The mac has very fast communication to do the first plot, many others are saying that they can do 2 plots but process time increases dramatically. Technology is constantly changing so continue to do research and ask in the chat rooms.</p>

<p><a href="ttps://www.homenethowto.com/ports-and-nat/upnp-automatic-port-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UPnP</a> is an optional setting that allows users to open a port in their router and therefore allow other nodes to connect to them. This is not required, since your node can still make outgoing connections without UPnP.</p>
<p>For some routers, UPnP is enabled automatically, but for others, you might have to go into your router settings and enable UPnP manually. Sometimes restarting the router is also necessary.</p>
<p>Another option is port forwarding, where you tell your router/NAT to forward requests on port 8444 or 58444 for testnet to your machine.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-should-i-not-run-more-than-one-node-on-a-home-network-and-whats-this-about-upnp">Why should I not run more than one node on a home network and what&#x27;s this about UPnP?<a href="#why-should-i-not-run-more-than-one-node-on-a-home-network-and-whats-this-about-upnp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Why should I not run more than one node on a home network and what&#x27;s this about UPnP?的直接链接" title="Why should I not run more than one node on a home network and what&#x27;s this about UPnP?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>First, running more than one node with the same private keys on your home network is wasting bandwidth by syncing two copies of the blockchain over your download link. You can get the same results by running one node and <a href="/zh-Hans/farming-on-many-machines/">using multiple harvesters</a> on multiple computers. Second, if you have <a href="https://www.homenethowto.com/ports-and-nat/upnp-automatic-port-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uPnP</a> enabled on both nodes and your home router supports uPnP (and most do) it will cause both of your nodes to not sync the blockchain. You need to disable uPnP on all or all but one node behind a uPnP enabled router. The CLI command <code>chia configure --enable-upnp false</code> will turn uPnP off on a node. It requires a restart of the node to take effect. If you disable UPnP on all but one of your nodes then your local router will forward inbound 8444 traffic to the one node and the rest will now be able to connect to the network but just will not accept inbound connections from the network.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-does-my-node-have-no-connections-how-can-i-get-more-connections">Why does my node have no connections? How can I get more connections?<a href="#why-does-my-node-have-no-connections-how-can-i-get-more-connections" class="hash-link" aria-label="Why does my node have no connections? How can I get more connections?的直接链接" title="Why does my node have no connections? How can I get more connections?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>Step 1. Make sure you are running the most recent version of the Chia software. Check out the <a href="/zh-Hans/installation/">Installation page</a>.</p>
<p>Step 2. If your node has no connections, it could be one of many reasons. The most likely reason is that there are no users with space to have new connections, so you cannot connect to them. To solve this, you should try opening port 8444 on your router so other peers can connect to you. Follow the steps in the <a href="/zh-Hans/node-syncing/">Node Syncing page</a>.</p>
<p>Port 8444 is the port through which other Chia computers can communicate with your PC. When you set up port forwarding on port 8444, the Chia software on your computer can quickly talk to other PCs, link up, and start downloading and syncing with the Chia blockchain.</p>
<p>The network is undergoing rapid growth and expansion. Many of the newly arrived Chia peers (computers) do not open up port 8444. It makes it very hard for the network. So please port forward on port 8444!</p>
<p>Use this link to check if your router&#x27;s port 8444 is closed: <a href="https://portchecker.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://portchecker.co/</a></p>
<p>Step 3: You might need to disable UPnP in the config file (~/.chia/mainnet/config/config.yaml) or by using the cli command <code>chia configure -upnp false</code>. You might have multiple nodes running on the same machine, or in the same wifi network. Make sure to close all Chia applications on your computer. Also check your firewall or antivirus software, which might be blocking connections.</p>
<p>Step 4: Try deleting your peer DB which is located at <code>~/.chia/mainnet/db/peer_table_node.sqlite</code>. Close then restart Chia.</p>
<p>Step 5: Edit <code>~/.chia/mainnet/config/config.yaml</code>, search for <code>weight_proof_timeout</code> and increase it from 180 to 400. If that value is not there, you can add it under the <code>full_node</code> section.</p>
<p>It can take a few minutes to start receiving peers and several hours to completely sync.</p>

<p>This is usually a system clock issue, which is causing the display of &quot;Not synced&quot;, even though you are. Your clock must be set to the exact time, and cannot be more than 5 minutes off. Check your phone and your computer and ensure the time is the same.</p>

<p>Chia began using version 2 of its blockchain database in 2022. Version 1 has since reached its end-of-life.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-version-2">About version 2<a href="#about-version-2" class="hash-link" aria-label="About version 2的直接链接" title="About version 2的直接链接">​</a></h4>
<p>Version 2 of the database is still written in SQLite, but it has undergone a series of optimizations from version 1, such as storing hashes in binary, rather than human-readable hex format. It also is more compressed than version 1. These two factors combined have resulted in an approximately 45% reduction in the size of the database, as well as a slight improvement in its performance.</p>
<p>If you install a brand new full node in Chia 1.3 or later, version 2 of the database will be created when you run <code>chia init</code>. If you want to stick with version 1, simply run <code>chia init --v1-db</code> instead.</p>
<p>If you were already were running a full node prior to upgrading to Chia 1.3, the upgrade will not happen automatically. The command to perform the upgrade is <code>chia db upgrade</code>. This is documented in detail in our <a href="/zh-Hans/cli/">CLI reference</a>. In this case, your options are to download a <a href="https://www.chia.net/downloads/#database-checkpoint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">database checkpoint</a> or to upgrade to version 2 manually, as described below.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-the-upgrade-process">About the upgrade process<a href="#about-the-upgrade-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="About the upgrade process的直接链接" title="About the upgrade process的直接链接">​</a></h4>
<p>If you still have a copy of version 1 of the database, you can upgrade it to version 2. This upgrade will not happen automatically. The command to perform the upgrade is <code>chia db upgrade</code>. This is documented in detail in our <a href="/zh-Hans/cli/#upgrade">CLI reference</a>. Be sure you have enough free space on the disk that contains your database file to write the new file.</p>
<p>The upgrade could take several hours. The upgrade could take several hours, so feel free to perform it at your leisure. After the upgrade has completed, run <code>chia start farmer -r</code> to restart your farmer and switch to the new database.</p>
<p>Note that the new database will have the same peak as version 1 at the time you <em>initiated</em> the upgrade. Your node will still need to run a short sync to fetch the remaining blocks that had gotten added while the upgrade was being performed.</p>
<p>Because the upgrade from version 1 to 2 of the database is time-consuming, most users will likely only perform it on one of their systems and copy the new database file to their other systems afterward. If you choose this option, be sure to either copy the file <em>before</em> running <code>chia start farmer -r</code>, or stop Chia altogether if it is already using the new database. Once the database is swapped from v1 to v2, you also need to update your <code>config.yaml</code> to reflect the new v2 database change. Under the <code>full_node:</code> section set <code>database_path: db/blockchain_v1_CHALLENGE.sqlite</code> to <code>database_path: db/blockchain_v2_CHALLENGE.sqlite</code></p>

<p>When you load Chia&#x27;s client GUI for the first time, you&#x27;ll be asked to choose whether to run in Wallet Mode or Farming Mode. Here are the main features of each mode:</p>
<p>Wallet Mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>This mode runs a Chia wallet, but not a full node.</li>
<li>The wallet will sync by connecting to external peers.</li>
<li>You&#x27;ll be able to send and receive Chia and/or CATs.</li>
<li>Farming will be disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Farming Mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>This mode runs a full node, so farming will be enabled.</li>
<li>The wallet will also sync by connecting to external peers, unless specific conditions are met (see below).</li>
<li>You&#x27;ll be able to send and receive Chia and/or CATs, just as while running in Wallet Mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>To switch between Wallet Mode and Farming Mode, click the gear icon on the upper-right side of your client. The settings menu will appear. Click the desired mode.</p>
<p>Note that in both modes, the light wallet protocol is always used. This protocol will sync your wallet by only downloading information from a subset of the blocks. The more transactions your wallet has had, the longer this process will require.</p>
<p>The following are situations when your wallet will NOT connect to external peers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>connect_to_unknown_peers = false</code> is set in config.yaml, under <code>wallet:</code>.</li>
<li>Your wallet is connected to a trusted node (typically this is your local host) AND that node is fully synced.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re running Chia for the first time and you have not modified <code>connect_to_unknown_peers</code>. Here is one potential workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the GUI and select Wallet Mode.</li>
<li>Your wallet will sync by downloading relevant information from external peers.</li>
<li>Change to Farmer Mode. Your full node will be started. Your wallet will continue to download relevant information from external peers.</li>
<li>After your full node has synced, your wallet will automatically connect to your full node in order to stay synced. It will terminate its connections with external peers.</li>
<li>Change to Wallet Mode. Your full node will continue to run in the background, and your wallet will remain connected to your full node in order to stay synced.</li>
<li>Stop and restart Chia. You will return to Wallet Mode, and your full node will no longer be running. Your Chia client is now in state 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on how you are using your Chia client, we recommend the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Casual users who are not farming or running a business such as a DEX can use Wallet Mode.</li>
<li>Farmers need to run in Farming Mode.</li>
<li>Anyone running a business, as well as anyone who frequently trades XCH or CATs, should do one of the following:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Run in Farming Mode. Only transact when your node is fully synced.</li>
<li>Set <code>connect_to_unknown_peers = false</code>. Run in either Wallet Mode or Farming Mode.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two types of peer nodes -- trusted/known and untrusted/unknown. By default, your local node is your only trusted node. It is possible to add other nodes to the trusted list, for example if you personally run more than one full node. One reason to add a trusted node is to speed up the sync time of your light wallet.</p>
<p>The light wallet protocol has two techniques to sync:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have access to at least one trusted node that is fully synced, then your wallet will sync by downloading blocks only from your trusted node(s)</li>
<li>Otherwise, your wallet will sync by connecting to, and downloading from, multiple untrusted nodes, and verifying that the information downloaded from each node is the same</li>
</ol>
<p>Typically, it is much faster to sync a wallet by connecting to a trusted node. Therefore, if you have access to a synced node that you trust, you may want to add that node to your trusted peers list. <em>We recommend that you only add your own full nodes to this list</em>.</p>

<p>This response will give a non-technical overview of Chia&#x27;s light wallet syncing process. For technical info, see <a href="/zh-Hans/light-clients/">our docs site</a>, as well as the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/226.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlyClient White Paper</a>, which details the process from which Chia&#x27;s light client is based.</p>
<p>First, a bit about addresses in Chia. A single Chia wallet can use up to four billion (2^32) addresses. Hopefully, you won&#x27;t need more than that! Using multiple addresses can help provide anonymity. Rather than having to sign up for a new account each time you want to receive money, you can simply click &quot;NEW ADDRESS&quot; and <em>presto</em> -- a new address appears. Additionally, each time you receive change from sending money, a new address is automatically generated. Your wallet keeps track of each of the addresses that have been used. As long as your wallet is synced, it always knows how much money you have.</p>
<p>One important thing to remember is that your wallet addresses will always be generated <em>in the same order</em>. When you generate a &quot;new&quot; address, you&#x27;re actually calculating the <em>next</em> address in the sequence. Your wallet doesn&#x27;t know what the next address will be until it&#x27;s generated, but the sequence will always be the same. For example, if you generate 50 new addresses (and write them down), and then install Chia on a new computer and import the same wallet, the first 50 addresses you generate will <em>exactly</em> match those from your original computer.</p>
<p>Next, we&#x27;ll introduce a setting called <code>initial_num_public_keys</code>. This setting is part of <code>config.yaml</code>, located in <code>~/.chia/mainnet/config</code> on Linux and MacOS, and <code>C:\Users\&amp;#060;username&amp;#062;\.chia\mainnet\config</code> on Windows. The default value of this setting is 100. The majority of users should <em>not</em> change it.</p>
<p>You can think of <code>initial_num_public_keys</code> as the number of future addresses to examine. It&#x27;s a window that expands with time (and never contracts). Here&#x27;s how it works:</p>
<p>The first time you run Chia&#x27;s software, your wallet will attempt to sync. It does this by checking the first address in the sequence. If that address has ever received money, your wallet will account for that transaction history and examine the next address, and so on. It would take a <em>very</em> long time to examine all four billion addresses, so your wallet will stop looking at some point. This is where <code>initial_num_public_keys</code> comes in.</p>
<p>By default, your wallet will stop after it has examined 100 straight addresses that have never received money. If it examines 50 empty addresses and then finds a transaction on the 51st address, the number left to examine is reset back to 100. Because the addresses always appear in the same sequence, it will be rare to have even a single address without any transaction history. But there is one exception: if you click &quot;NEW ADDRESS&quot; twice, then one address will remain unused. If you click &quot;NEW ADDRESS&quot; 101 times without receiving money at any of those addresses, then you&#x27;ll have 100 consecutive unused addresses in the sequence. Let&#x27;s say you receive money at the 101st address. When your wallet attempts to sync, it will stop looking after the 100th blank address. Transactions from subsequent addresses will remain undiscovered, and your balance will be incorrect.</p>
<p>The default setting for <code>initial_num_public_keys</code> is quite conservative -- it should be rare for anyone to click &quot;NEW ADDRESS&quot; more than 100 times without actually using any of those addresses. That said, you might have a legitimate reason to do this, for example if you&#x27;re running an exchange. In that case, feel free to set <code>initial_num_public_keys</code> to a higher number, stop your wallet, delete your wallet database, and start your wallet again to begin a fresh sync.</p>
<p>Why not set <code>initial_num_public_keys</code> to a higher number by default? Because it would take longer for your wallet to sync. Why not set it lower? If the default setting were 2, most wallets would likely still show the correct balance and the sync time would be faster. However, we set the default to 100 to prioritize showing the correct balance over syncing as fast as possible.</p>
<p>How does your wallet know it has the correct info for each address? It polls one or more of its peers. These peers can be either trusted or untrusted, as explained in the <a href="#what-are-trusted-peers-and-how-do-i-add-them">previous question</a>. By default, your own node is the only one you trust. If your node is fully synced, then your wallet only needs to query your node to determine your transaction history for each address. If your node is not fully synced, then your wallet will query a number of peers about this info. If any of them lie, omit info, or disconnect in the middle of a query, your wallet will know because the responses won&#x27;t all match.</p>
<p>If you believe your balance is incorrect, changing <code>initial_num_public_keys</code> is unlikely to fix the problem. If at all possible, you should sync a full node, stop Chia, delete your wallet database, and start Chia again. This time, Chia will sync based on your own node alone. If this is not an option, then resyncing from untrustred nodes might fix the problem as well.</p>

<p>By default, when you start a Chia full node, it will attempt to connect to a random set of peers. This is normally fine, but there are some cases in which you might want to connect to the same peer(s) every time, such as if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are a pool operator who wants to establish consistent groups of nodes to support your pool</li>
<li>You are running a small, private testnet where all peers are known</li>
<li>You are connecting to a larger testnet which nonetheless has an insufficient number of nodes to locate your first peer immediately upon starting a full node</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps to connect to the same full node peers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Edit config.yaml. This file is located in <code>~/.chia/mainnet/config</code> on Linux and MacOS, and <code>C:\Users\&amp;#060;username&amp;#062;\.chia\mainnet\config</code> on Windows.</li>
<li>In the <code>full_node:</code> section, you should see the following line: <code>full_node_peers: []</code>
<ul>
<li>If you are upgrading an existing Chia installation, these settings won&#x27;t be added automatically. In this case, you will need to either add them manually or delete <code>config.yaml</code> and run <code>chia init</code> to generate a new copy.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you see plots in the Plots section of the Farm page in the GUI - your plots are being farmed. You will see challenges and proof attempts as they come through in the Last Attempted Proof section however you usually will not have a proof worth sending to the network due to the <a href="/zh-Hans/faq/#what-is-the-plot-filter-and-why-didnt-my-plot-pass-it">plot filter</a>. You can additionally see the Total Size of Plots on the Farm view and it will tell you how much unique space is being farmed and statistically how long it should take - on average - to win a block.

<p>Farmers compute a plot filter based on the signage point, their plot id, and the sub-slot challenge - which are hashed together to create the plot filter bits. If the plot filter bits start with 9 zeroes, that plot passes the filter for that signage point, and can proceed. This disqualifies around 511/512 of all proofs of space on the network, for each signage point. There are 4608 * 2 or 9216 signage points per day so the average plot should pass the filter 18 times per 24 hours on average. Once a plot passes the plot filter it then competes for the best proof of space with every other plot that also passed that plot filter for that signage point. For reasons that aren&#x27;t super simple to intuit, the only thing each plot is competing on is to have the best proof of space and thus the chances of getting a reward depend on total size of plots on the farm - even with the plot filter in place.</p>
<p>As long as the plot passes the filter, and do not have any internal file errors, the plot will always be eligible to compete for the best proof of space. Moving the plot to another directory or server will not change its eligibility.</p>
<p>Please note that the speed of your lookups when passing the plot filter should be below 5 and preferably below 2 seconds. When you actually win a reward, your drive will have to do more lookups than these, so it&#x27;s important that the the lookups are happening fast.</p>

If your harvester misses 9 signage points per day, then your farm was operational 99.9% of the time. This would be considered normal, even for a farm with a stable internet connection.

If you are consistently missing more than 1% of the signage points, or around 100 per day, then it is probably worth investigating the cause.</p>
<p>Some reasons your harvester might miss more than 100 signage points per day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your harvester can&#x27;t handle its required compute load -- typically this will happen if you are farming with compressed plots. However, even with uncompressed plots, if your harvester sometimes requires more than five seconds to perform its lookups, it may miss some signage points. See our <a href="/zh-Hans/plotting-compression/">plotting documentation</a> for more info on how determine the maximum number of plots your harvesters can handle.

<li>Lost connections to peers -- check your peer count by clicking the <code>FULL NODE</code> icon in the upper right corner of your farmer GUI. If you only have a few peers, your local network might have a <a href="#what-is-this-upnp-error">UPNP issue</a>.

<li>Changed external IP address -- some ISPs will change the IP address of their customers frequently and without warning. This may be happening to your home network. Your ISP might be able to provide you with more info. Unfortunately, if this is happening, often the only recourse is to pay for a dedicated IP address. This may be happening to your home network.

If your local network loses internet connectivity for a few seconds, you might miss a signage point.</li>

<p>This was our advice in 2020, long before the launch of mainnet. However, we no longer advise anyone to delete their winning plots.</p>
<p>Some background: The consensus Chia originally used during the testnet phase contained the possibility of an <a href="https://docs.chia.net/consensus-attacks#bribe-trunk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attack</a> where an attacker who could co-ordinate N deep from the tip of the chain could try to coerce a winning farmer to re-write a historical transaction block. However, before the launch of mainnet, the consensus was updated; this attack is no longer viable. See the link for more details.</p>

<p>No, your plots are virtually unaffected by the passage of time, aside from hardware errors. Even in the presence of bit flips due to aging hardware, plots remain mostly effective. The only cases where you would need to re-plot are: 1. if you are using solo plots (not NFT plots) and wish to join a pool (please see note below) or 2. if hardware speeds advance to the point of a certain k value becoming obsolete (e.g., <code>k=32</code> becomes too fast to plot and we ban them, forcing you to replace them with <code>k≧33</code> plots). For case 1., you are free to have any mix of solo plots and pool plots if you do not want to re-plot. For case 2., <code>k=32</code> is not expected to become outdated until sometime between 2026-2031.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note on case 1: We have added a Pooling Protocol that replaces the hard-coded &quot;Pool Public Key&quot; of a plot, with a plotNFT&#x27;s &quot;Pool Contract Address&quot; - more on this subject can be read here: <a href="https://docs.chia.net/pool-farming/#pooling-faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.chia.net/pool-farming/#pooling-faq</a></li>

<p>It is unlikely, but it is possible. There are multiple reasons why this might be the case. The most common is that due to network delay, or drive speed delay (for example using a slow NAS), you missed the time for inclusion into the blockchain, which is 28 seconds. This time is from when the timelords create the signage points, to when the timelords infuse your block. Check to make sure that you are connected and synced to multiple peers, and that your quality lookup are fast (&lt;2 seconds, definitely less than 5). Another reason might be that the signage point where you won did not get included into the blockchain. This can sometimes happen, since timelords may publish signage points that don&#x27;t end up on chain.</p>

<p>The coin (or <a href="https://river.com/learn/bitcoins-utxo-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UTXO</a>) model is a Bitcoin-style transaction model which is also used in Chia. Your wallet keeps track of a set of coins, where each coin can be any amount of XCH. When spending a coin (making a transaction), you have to spend the entire amount, and split that coin into multiple outputs, called coin additions. One addition is to the recipient of the transaction, and the other one is to you, as change. The change usually goes to a new address, so you will not see it in your normal address on Chia explorer, but your wallet will keep track of it and include it in the balance. Each block in Chia is a list of removals (coins spent) and additions (coins created). There are no transactions in the blockchain, which is why you cannot lookup transactions in the block explorers.</p>

<p>HD or Hierarchical Deterministic keys are a type of public key/private key scheme where one private key can have a nearly infinite number of different public keys (and therefor wallet receive addresses) that will all ultimately come back to and be spendable by a single private key.</p>

<li>GUI may not be fully refreshed. Try the &quot;force reload&quot; option under View to force the GUI to refresh.</li>
<li>It&#x27;s possible the wallet DB may be corrupted. Deleting the wallet DB will resolve this, but will also cause you to lose any Offer history and you will need to setup your CAT wallets again.</li>
</ol>
<p>To delete your wallet DB follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shut down Chia and all Chia processes, check the task manager to see if they are all shut down. <em>Note that this will cancel running plots</em>, so be careful.</li>
<li>Restart your computer (if there are still running processes and you can&#x27;t get those processes to quit)</li>

<p>Your pending transaction can take a few minutes if blocks are full. If it&#x27;s not confirmed after a while, your pending transaction might be stuck. Try the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shut down your wallet and node</li>
<li>Delete your wallet db files: located at <code>~/.chia/mainnet/wallet/db</code>. This will require syncing up your wallet, but not your node. And then you can resubmit the transaction.</li>
<li>Make sure you have upgraded to the latest version</li>
<li>Start the application and wait for the wallet to sync up</li>
<li>After your wallet is fully synced to the same height as the Full Node, your Wallet Balance will be correct.</li>
</ol>
<p>Known problem: After your wallet is resynced, any previous outgoing transaction will appear as incoming transaction at the block height you made the outgoing transaction.</p>

<p>If you were running the light wallet beta app (v1.2.11 dev 265) and you&#x27;ve upgraded to the latest beta (v1.2.12+), you can get your offer history and your CAT wallets back by following these instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close the Chia app</li>
<li>Check the following directory: <code>~/.chia/mainnet/wallet/db</code> if it&#x27;s not empty, then be sure to delete all the .sqlite files that match the key (e.g., <code>blockchain_wallet_v2_mainnet_1123456789.sqlite</code>)</li>
<li>copy the file(s) from <code>~/.chia/standalone_wallet/wallet/db/blockchain_wallet_v1_mainnet_123456789.sqlite_new</code> to <code>~/.chia/mainnet/wallet/db</code></li>
<li>rename the file <code>~/.chia/mainnet/wallet/db/blockchain_wallet_v1_mainnet_123456789.sqlite_new</code> to <code>blockchain_wallet_v2_mainnet_123456789.sqlite</code></li>

<p>This is because of the newly integrated light wallet client sync. The wallet will sync through the light wallet sync while the full node syncs up in the background. Once the full node is synced up, then the wallet will sync primarily through the local trusted full node.</p>

<p>The wallet no longer automatically adds unknown CATs wallets for CATs that may have been airdropped to your wallet. This is to help ensure that syncing doesn&#x27;t slow down with all the additional CATs that could suddenly show up. It is recommended that you use a tail database to look up and add. We understand that this will add some extra work to know which CATs to add wallets for and set them up manually. We do hope to improve upon this experience Soon™</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-dust-filter">What is the dust filter?<a href="#what-is-the-dust-filter" class="hash-link" aria-label="What is the dust filter?的直接链接" title="What is the dust filter?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>In crypto parlance, &quot;dust&quot; refers to coins that have almost no value. In Chia, the smallest denomination is 1 mojo, or 1-trillionth of an XCH. Unsolicited coins of this value certainly count as dust, but even much larger coins, for example 1 million mojos, are still worth a fraction of a penny.</p>
<p>Chia experienced its first &quot;dust storm&quot; in late 2021. The &quot;duster&quot; spammed the blockchain with millions of tiny coins, likely in an attempt to stress-test the network. Chia&#x27;s blockchain is robust, so it continued without issue. However, many people ended up with thousands of dust coins in their wallets. This proved problematic.</p>
<p>In version 1.2.x, wallets that had received tens of thousands of dust coins were unable to sync. The task of optimizing our wallet was a difficult one, but by version 1.3 we had made significant improvements, and these wallets could finally sync.</p>
<p>However, sync times for dusted wallets were still measured in days, which was unacceptable. We continued making optimizations, and by version 1.5.1, a wallet with over 100,000 coins could sync within a few minutes. But we wanted to reduce those sync times even more.</p>
<p>The dust filter is a new feature, added in version 1.6.0. It is activated whenever there are at least a certain number of unspent dust coins in the wallet. While activated, the filter ignores any coins considered &quot;dust&quot;.</p>
<p>Two new settings have been added to <code>~/.chia/mainnet/config/config.yaml</code> in the <code>wallet</code> section:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>spam_filter_after_n_txs: 200</code></li>
<li><code>xch_spam_amount: 1000000</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are upgrading an existing Chia installation, these settings won&#x27;t be added automatically. In this case, you will need to either add them manually or delete <code>config.yaml</code> and run <code>chia init</code> to generate a new copy.</p>
<p>The default settings essentially say, &quot;If my wallet contains more than 200 coins, ignore all coins after the first 200 that are worth less than 1 million mojos.&quot; Note that the filter is not applied for CATs or NFTs.</p>
<p>You can modify these default values to support different functionality. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable the filter by setting <code>xch_spam_amount</code> to <code>0</code> (nothing is dust)</li>
<li>Enable the filter regardless of your wallet&#x27;s status by setting <code>spam_filter_after_n_txs</code> to <code>0</code></li>
<li>Consider coins to be &quot;dust&quot; only if they are smaller than 100 mojos by setting <code>xch_spam_amount</code> to <code>100</code></li>
</ul>
<p>However, we believe the default settings will be sufficient for most users.</p>
<p>Note that if the number of unspent coins in your wallet falls to 200 (by default) or lower, then the dust filter will be deactivated. This could happen if you spend or consolidate some of your coins.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-is-my-wallets-balance-inconsistent">Why is my wallet&#x27;s balance inconsistent?<a href="#why-is-my-wallets-balance-inconsistent" class="hash-link" aria-label="Why is my wallet&#x27;s balance inconsistent?的直接链接" title="Why is my wallet&#x27;s balance inconsistent?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>If you have more than two hundred unspent coins (by default) in your wallet, the dust filter will be activated. Depending on which mode your wallet is using, your balance could show slight differences each time you sync. This is because the coins will not necessarily show up in the same order while syncing.</p>
<p>The maximum difference in your balance is <code>spam_filter_after_n_txs * xch_spam_amount</code>. However, the actual difference will rarely be more than a few thousand mojos.</p>
<p>There are three potential scenarios:</p>
<ol>

<p>This error can occur when attempting to send XCH, CATs, or NFTs. Unfortunately, the error is vague, so there is a bit of guesswork in determining the cause. In the future, we plan to make this error -- along with the recommended way to fix it -- more specific.</p>
<p>Some of the potential causes include:</p>
<ol>
<li>You don&#x27;t have enough money in your wallet. Double check your wallet&#x27;s <code>Total Balance</code>.</li>
<li>You have enough money, but one or more of your coins are locked. Chia uses the <a href="#what-is-the-coin-model">coin set model</a> of accounting, where everything is a coin. If some of your coins are part of either a pending transaction or an <a href="#offers">Offer</a>, they have been temporarily locked. In this case, your <code>Spendable Balance</code> is less than your <code>Total Balance</code>. In order to unlock these coins, cancel any pending offers and click <code>Actions</code> --&gt; <code>Delete Unconfirmed Transactions</code> in your wallet&#x27;s <code>Summary</code> panel.</li>
<li>The CLVM cost of your transaction is greater than the maximum cost allowed. In order to add a Chia transaction to the blockchain, a certain amount of processing power is required. This is the transaction&#x27;s <em>cost</em>. When sending a single coin or NFT to another wallet, the cost is low. However, if you are attempting to send hundreds of coins or dozens of NFTs in a single transaction, the total cost could be prohibitively high, thus triggering the error. One way to fix this is to break your large transaction into multiple smaller ones -- try sending only the amount indicated in the error message. Another fix is to <a href="/zh-Hans/wallet-cli/#combine">combine your coins</a> by opening a command prompt or terminal window and running <code>chia wallet coins combine</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, no. However, to obtain the user-specified wallet names programmatically, you can use the <code>chia keys label show</code> CLI command.</p>
<p>Another way to obtain this info is by connecting to the daemon over a websocket by using <code>wscat</code>:</p>

<p>Starting in version 1.7.0, Chia&#x27;s reference wallet will accept both 12- and 24-word mnemonics. This allows you to import a mnemonic from another wallet. Simply click <code>IMPORT FROM 12 WORD MNEMONIC</code> when importing your wallet. However, do keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chia&#x27;s reference wallet only allows you to <em>import</em> a 12-word mnemonic. It does not allow you to create a new 12-word mnemonic.</li>
<li>Certain wallets use 12-word mnemonics that are not compatible with Chia&#x27;s reference wallet. As far as we know, this only applies to the Pawket wallet, but there may be others as well. In the case of Pawket, you need to export a 24-word mnemonic from their app in order to use Chia&#x27;s reference wallet. More info can be found on their <a href="https://info.pawket.app/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ page</a>.</li>

<p>By default, Chia will update your receive address for every new transaction. This is done for privacy reasons -- it is more difficult to associate multiple transactions with the same wallet if each transaction uses a different address.</p>
<p>However, there are some downsides to using multiple addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be more difficult to track the history of your own transactions. For example, block explorers cannot associate multiple addresses with the same wallet. (Note, however, that the reference wallet <em>will</em> show you a complete history.)</li>
<li>Some wallets only search a limited number of addresses for a given key, so they may not display your full balance.</li>
<li>Wallet performance can degrade after a large number of addresses have been used. This is because the wallet must search for transactions for each address in the derivation index.</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting in version 1.7.1, Chia&#x27;s reference wallet will allow you to keep the same receive address with each transaction. If you change this setting, each of the above issues will be mitigated, at the expense of reduced privacy.</p>
<p>To set up your wallet to reuse the same receive address:</p>
<ol>
<li>Edit <code>~/.chia/mainnet/config/config.yaml</code></li>
<li>Search for <code>reuse_public_key_for_change:</code></li>
</ol>

<li>Each of the spend bundles that spend the coin must have identical solutions for spending that particular coin</li>
</ol>
<p>In cases where both of these requirements are met, when a farmer creates a block, it will choose one of the identical spends from the mempool as the &quot;winner&quot;, based on which transaction pays the highest fee-per-cost. The remaining copies of that spend will then be deduplicated against the winner (they will be aggregated into a single spend). Any announcements the coin makes will then be available for any other spend to assert within the same block. The remaining copies of that spend will then be deduplicated against the winner (they will be aggregated into a single spend). Any announcements the coin makes will then be available for any other spend to assert within the same block.</p>

<p>In Chia versions prior to 1.8.2, two key features were not supported by the mempool:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ability of a transaction to spend the output of another mempool item (i.e. inter-transaction ephemeral spends)</li>
<li>The ability to assert an announcement made by another mempool item (i.e. inter-transaction announcements)</li>
</ol>
<p>These features both would necessitate the creation of dependency graphs, which a farmer would need to solve (and ideally optimize) when creating a block.</p>
<p>Regarding feature 1, the only ephemeral spends that are currently supported must come from the same spend bundle. <em>Inter-transaction</em> ephemeral spends are not yet supported as of version 1.8.2. <em>Inter-transaction</em> ephemeral spends are not yet supported as of version 1.8.2.</p>
<p>Chia version 1.8.2 introduces identical spend aggregation, which addresses some of the use cases of Feature 2. Spends that make use of this feature are still restricted by the lack of <code>AGG_SIG_*</code> conditions, which means that anyone who needs to assert an announcement from an aggregated spend could also have spent the coin. However, this version brings Chia one step closer to offering full support for inter-transaction announcements.</p>

<p>This error message occurs when you submit a transaction that does not include a high enough fee, for example when the network is quite busy. Try submitting the transaction again with a higher fee (100 million mojos will generally suffice for standard transactions).

<p>When you create an offer, <a href="https://chialisp.com/offers#offer-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coins are reserved</a> to ensure that when the offer has been accepted and written on to the blockchain, the transaction can be completed. Chia&#x27;s wallet will reserve the largest coin to fulfill an offer, and when that coin is reserved, it will lower the spendable balance by the total coin amount.</p>

<p>You should always check the ID of the asset(s) being offered before accepting any offers. First make sure you have a CAT wallet set up for the assets that you are trading for and are getting that information from a reputable source. Second, when you view the offer in the wallet, ensure the amounts and the CATs match up to what you are expecting.

<p>Yes, the coin can be spent from another computer. Coins are reserved locally on the computer where the offer was created. If that coin is spent from another computer, then the offer will be canceled. In general, it is recommended that you don&#x27;t use two machines to access the same wallet that offers are being made from.</p>

<p>Chia NFTs make use of a unique feature: <a href="https://chialisp.com/offers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Offers</a>. You may already have used Offers to trade XCH and CATs, but to summarize, they enable the trustless, peer-to-peer exchange of assets on Chia&#x27;s ecosystem, with no involvement from central parties or intermediaries. And now you can use them to buy and sell NFTs, as well. Simply click the Offers button in your Electron wallet, then click &quot;Create an Offer&quot; and &quot;NFT Offer&quot;. We&#x27;ll have a more detailed guide that includes all of the options soon.</p>

<p>The CLI commands for NFT offers are almost the same as <a href="https://chialisp.com/offers-cli-tutorial#create-a-single-token-offer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">those for CAT offers</a>. The main difference is that you have to include the NFT singleton&#x27;s value after the NFT ID (typically this is <code>:1</code>). For example, to make an offer, you can run:</p>

<p>是的。 Just as with XCH and CATs, you can send NFTs to an XCH address. If the recipient doesn&#x27;t have an NFT wallet, one will be created automatically.</p>

<p>As with buying NFTs, you can also sell them using Offers. Simply create an Offer in your Electron wallet, then send it wherever you want, including to our community galleries and marketplaces such as <a href="https://mintgarden.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MintGarden</a>, <a href="https://dexie.space/markets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dexie</a>, and <a href="https://www.spacescan.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SpaceScan</a>. If an Offer file is modified, then that copy is no longer valid. This means that you can share your Offers with confidence -- the only thing a &quot;thief&quot; can do with your Offer is accept it.</p>

<p>As of version 1.6.1, you can use the Offer Builder to construct an offer of any asset(s) for any other asset(s). This includes offering XCH, CATs, and NFTs on both sides of the offer.</p>

<p>A sale involves using an offer, which in turn requires an NFT to be exchanged for one or more assets. Any time you want to buy or sell an NFT, you will create or accept an Offer. Royalties are built into the NFT, so they will automatically be accounted for when the offer is created/accepted.</p>
<p>A transfer is where you move an NFT from one address to another. No money is exchanged, and there are no royalties. The two main use cases for transferring an NFT are</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving an NFT to another wallet that you own</li>
<li>Giving an NFT away for free</li>
</ul>

<p>No. You can send and receive NFTs from the same address you have used in the past. One caveat is that if you send an NFT to an address that is currently running on a pre-1.4 wallet, your wallet won&#x27;t <em>recognize</em> the NFT. However, the NFT will be safely kept inside your wallet, and it will become accessible after you upgrade to version 1.4 or greater.</p>

<p>If you are comfortable using a command line interface (CLI), then you can follow our <a href="/zh-Hans/guides/nft-intro/">dev guide</a> to mint an NFT. If you prefer a browser-based minting tool, options include <a href="https://mintgarden.io/mint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MintGarden</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OmakaseaNFT/chia-nft-util" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Omakasea ChiaNFT</a>.

<p>Yes, but you need to use an RPC. If you use the CLI command, the comma will be interpreted as a delimiter -- two separate URLs will be created. However, even though URLs that include commas are generally not recommended, they should work with the RPC command. You don&#x27;t even need to escape the comma or use extra quotes. But, as with all things NFT-related, you should test this functionality on the testnet before attempting it on mainnet.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-it-mean-to-self-custody-an-nft">What does it mean to self-custody an NFT?<a href="#what-does-it-mean-to-self-custody-an-nft" class="hash-link" aria-label="What does it mean to self-custody an NFT?的直接链接" title="What does it mean to self-custody an NFT?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>On other blockchains, NFTs are typically custodied in a marketplace. This is akin to having an account with a company. The marketplace has a reputational motivation to keep your NFT safe and secure, but your NFT is still in their hands.</p>
<p><em>Self custody</em> means that you have control over your own assets. The same mantra of &quot;Not your keys, not your coins&quot; also applies to NFTs. When you self-custody your Chia NFTs, it means that they are controlled by <em>your</em> keys, and therefore they are <em>your</em> assets.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="where-does-my-nft-live">Where does my NFT live?<a href="#where-does-my-nft-live" class="hash-link" aria-label="Where does my NFT live?的直接链接" title="Where does my NFT live?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>There are two components of a Chia NFT: on-chain and off-chain.</p>
<p><strong>On-Chain:</strong> An NFT is a special type of coin called a &quot;singleton&quot;. It contains three lists of URIs, which link to:</p>
<ol>
<li>The NFT&#x27;s data. This is typically an image file.</li>
<li>The NFT&#x27;s metadata. This is typically a JSON file containing information about the NFT.</li>
<li>The NFT&#x27;s license. This is typically a text file the spells out what rights the NFT&#x27;s owner has.</li>
</ol>
<p>The URI lists can only be prepended to; existing URIs cannot be modified or deleted.</p>
<p>For security purposes, each NFT contains a hash of the data represented by each of the corresponding URIs. The hashes can never be modified after minting.</p>
<p><strong>Off-Chain:</strong> The actual NFT image lives in at least one location online. It can be stored under any number of URI protocols, including (but not limited to) http, https, ftp and ipfs.</p>
<p>Because Chia NFTs use a <em>list</em> of URIs (as opposed to a single one), the image can be stored in multiple locations. This is important for preserving an NFT&#x27;s permanence because a single link could break.</p>
<p>For high-end NFTs, you may even want to store the image offline. Why would you do this? Let&#x27;s say each of the online links is broken. As long as you (or anyone else) has a copy of the image, you can upload it and add a new link to the NFT. As long as the image&#x27;s hash matches the hash that&#x27;s built into the NFT, the new image is guaranteed to be identical to the original, and therefore valid. It is for these reasons that we believe NFTs on Chia will have stronger permanence than on any other blockchain.</p>
<p>The same rules apply for the metadata and license information. They can exist in multiple locations, but their hashes may not be modified after the initial minting. This prevents future owners from modifying this information, even though they can add new links.</p>
<p>The metadata URI can provide a wide variety of information about the NFT, including its title, properties (eg - year created, attributes, colors used, etc), rankings (eg - power: 25 out of 100, etc), collection name, as well as series number (eg - 1 of 100). The NFT&#x27;s minter is free to include whatever information they want at the time of minting. The NFT1 spec allows different metadata formats to be developed. At the time of this writing, almost all NFTs use <a href="https://github.com/Chia-Network/chips/blob/main/CHIPs/chip-0007.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHIP-7</a>, which allows marketplaces to parse the metadata more easily.</p>
<p>The license URI can provide any relevant information concerning the NFT&#x27;s license, such as who owns the Intellectual Property.</p>

<p>You can add new URIs to the data, metadata and license URI lists of any NFT you own. The new URIs will always be prepended to the list (added to the front of the list).</p>

<p>Yes -- you can only add one link at a time. After the transaction has been processed, you can add another link.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="is-there-a-limit-to-the-total-data-size-of-the-metadata">Is there a limit to the total data size of the metadata?<a href="#is-there-a-limit-to-the-total-data-size-of-the-metadata" class="hash-link" aria-label="Is there a limit to the total data size of the metadata?的直接链接" title="Is there a limit to the total data size of the metadata?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>No. (Well, you can&#x27;t have infinite data, but Chia doesn&#x27;t enforce any limits.)</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="is-there-a-limit-to-the-number-of-links">Is there a limit to the number of links?<a href="#is-there-a-limit-to-the-number-of-links" class="hash-link" aria-label="Is there a limit to the number of links?的直接链接" title="Is there a limit to the number of links?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>Chia doesn&#x27;t enforce a limit. However, because the links are contained within the NFT, as you add links, the size of the NFT also grows. If you were to add thousands of links, the NFT would eventually grow so large, it wouldn&#x27;t fit inside a block and would no longer be spendable. If you only wanted to add a few dozen links, you would not run into this limitation.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="are-all-the-links-posted-on-every-spend-or-only-when-adding-them">Are all the links posted on every spend, or only when adding them?<a href="#are-all-the-links-posted-on-every-spend-or-only-when-adding-them" class="hash-link" aria-label="Are all the links posted on every spend, or only when adding them?的直接链接" title="Are all the links posted on every spend, or only when adding them?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>On Chia&#x27;s blockchain, everything is a coin. This includes XCH, CATs, and NFTs. Whenever any coin is spent, the original puzzle is revealed. Therefore, with NFTs, every link is posted on every spend.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-i-modify-links">Can I modify links?<a href="#can-i-modify-links" class="hash-link" aria-label="Can I modify links?的直接链接" title="Can I modify links?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>You cannot modify or remove any existing URIs, or their corresponding hashes. This was a design decision to keep NFTs from being arbitrarily modified after their minting.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="does-an-nft-transaction-take-longer-than-an-xch-or-cat-transaction">Does an NFT transaction take longer than an XCH (or CAT) transaction?<a href="#does-an-nft-transaction-take-longer-than-an-xch-or-cat-transaction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Does an NFT transaction take longer than an XCH (or CAT) transaction?的直接链接" title="Does an NFT transaction take longer than an XCH (or CAT) transaction?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>In Chia, all transactions within a single block are processed simultaneously. As long as your NFT makes it into a block, it will take the same amount of time as any other transaction to process. The only caveat is that NFTs have a higher CLVM cost than XCH transactions. Therefore, if the mempool is full, a higher fee will be required in order for an NFT to be included in a block. However, if the mempool is not full, then this caveat does not apply.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-much-is-the-fee-for-mintingselling-an-nft">How much is the fee for minting/selling an NFT?<a href="#how-much-is-the-fee-for-mintingselling-an-nft" class="hash-link" aria-label="How much is the fee for minting/selling an NFT?的直接链接" title="How much is the fee for minting/selling an NFT?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>If the mempool is not full, then no fee is needed. If the mempool is full, then in order for your transaction to be included into the next block, you&#x27;ll need to add a fee of at least 5 mojos per cost. The recommended minimum fee in this scenario is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minting an NFT with a DID: 615 million mojos</li>
<li>Transferring/selling an NFT: 335 million mojos</li>
</ul>
<p>For other scenarios, see <a href="/zh-Hans/guides/nft-intro/">our NFT developer documentation</a>.</p>

<p>An NFT&#x27;s royalty percentage and receive address may optionally be included in an NFT upon its minting. After the NFT has been minted, the royalty may never be modified. If an NFT includes a royalty, then every time the NFT is sold, the appropriate percentage of the sale will be paid to the royalty&#x27;s receive address (typically the address of the original artist). The amount paid both to the new owner, as well as the royalty address, will be clearly displayed within the Offer.</p>
<p>On other blockchains, royalties are paid at the discretion of the marketplace on which the NFT is custodied. On Chia, however, the royalties are built directly into the NFT. While under-the-table transfers could still circumvent royalties, they would also introduce counterparty risk for both the buyer and seller. In order to transfer a Chia NFT in a trustless manner, royalties must be paid.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="are-there-any-royalties-when-exchanging-an-nft-for-another-nft">Are there any royalties when exchanging an NFT for another NFT?<a href="#are-there-any-royalties-when-exchanging-an-nft-for-another-nft" class="hash-link" aria-label="Are there any royalties when exchanging an NFT for another NFT?的直接链接" title="Are there any royalties when exchanging an NFT for another NFT?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>No -- there would be no fair way to assess royalties for NFT-for-NFT offers, so these are treated as swaps with no royalties being calculated.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-are-royalties-calculated-in-offers-that-involve-multiple-assets">How are royalties calculated in offers that involve multiple assets?<a href="#how-are-royalties-calculated-in-offers-that-involve-multiple-assets" class="hash-link" aria-label="How are royalties calculated in offers that involve multiple assets?的直接链接" title="How are royalties calculated in offers that involve multiple assets?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>This depends on what assets are included in the offer. A few rules to keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>If more than one NFT is being traded, the royalties will be divided by the number of NFTs. For example:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>If 4 NFTs are being traded for 1 XCH, then each NFT will have an assumed price of 0.25 XCH<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>If the royalty for each NFT is 10%, then each NFT will receive a 0.025 XCH royalty, for a total royalty of 0.1</li>
<li>If the royalties are 10%, 8%, 5%, and 3%, then the NFTs will receive 0.025 XCH, 0.02 XCH, 0.0125 XCH, and 0.0075 XCH, for a total royalty of 0.65 XCH</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the NFTs are being traded for more than one fungible asset, then the royalties will be calculated for each asset individually<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>For example, if 1 NFT is being traded for both 1 XCH and 1000 SBX and it carries a 10% royalty, then the royalties shall be 0.1 XCH and 100 SBX for this sale</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If multiple NFTs are being traded for multiple fungible assets, then rules 1. and 2. will both be applied</li>
<li>When NFTs are traded for other NFTs, no royalties are exchanged</li>
</ol>

<p>An NFT can include a maximum of one royalty address. However, because the royalty address can be any XCH address, the address can correspond to a smart coin that splits all royalties between multiple recipient addresses. See <a href="https://github.com/Chia-Network/chips/pull/30" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHIP-8</a> for one potential implementation of split royalties.</p>

<p>The Profile in your wallet is a Decentralized Identifier (DID). These can be used for tracking an NFT&#x27;s provenance (history). Each NFT can be assigned to one DID. Though not strictly required, most NFTs will use DIDs for their added provenance. You can create a new DID by clicking the Settings button (the gear icon) in the lower left corner of Chia&#x27;s Electron wallet.</p>

<p>Chia&#x27;s <a href="/zh-Hans/guides/nft-bulk-mint/">bulk minting tool</a> allows you to mint 25 NFTs per block. If you attempt to mint more than this, you run the risk of your spend bundle sitting in the mempool for a long time. Additionally, if you don&#x27;t use the bulk minting tool (or a similar tool), you can only mint one NFT per block.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, fraud and outright theft are common in this space. If you take a few basic precautions, you&#x27;ll have a much better chance of keeping your NFTs safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never give away your wallet&#x27;s seed phrase. If anyone asks for it, they are attempting to scam you.</li>
<li>When viewing an offer for an NFT, always check its provenance. The links to do this are located below the image when viewing it in an offer. An NFT&#x27;s provenance is a complete record of its ownership history. This helps to verify that the NFT is authentic.</li>
<li>Avoid directly sending someone money in exchange for an NFT. Use offers whenever possible. Occasionally, legitimate projects may require you to send them a token in exchange for an NFT, but the most secure way to buy and sell NFTs is with offers.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your NFT is stolen, then unfortunately there&#x27;s not much you can do, other than offer to buy it back from the thief or the current owner. This is why you should be extra diligent in avoiding theft in the first place, beginning with following the above tips.</p>

<p>Chia Network Inc has no ability to censor content on the Chia blockchain. However, the metadata schema that most NFTs use includes a <code>&quot;sensitive_content&quot;</code> object, with a default value of <code>false</code>. This flag will indicate to wallets and marketplaces whether the NFT contains any sensitive content, which they can then use in deciding whether to display the NFT.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-i-configure-my-system-to-send-and-receive-notifications">How do I configure my system to send and receive notifications?<a href="#how-do-i-configure-my-system-to-send-and-receive-notifications" class="hash-link" aria-label="How do I configure my system to send and receive notifications?的直接链接" title="How do I configure my system to send and receive notifications?的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>Starting in version 1.6.1, you can send and receive notifications to a specified puzzle hash. This will eventually enable us to support sending an offer to an NFT&#x27;s owner without having to go through an exchange.</p>
<p>This functionality is disabled by default. It includes two settings in the <code>wallet:</code> section of <code>~/.chia/mainnet/config/config.yaml</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>accept_notifications</code> - a boolean to specify whether you want to allow notifications to be received. If this setting is missing, it will automatically be set to <code>false</code>. Set to <code>true</code> to receive notifications</li>
<li><code>required_notification_amount</code> - the amount (in mojos) you require to be sent with a notification in order to receive it. If this setting is not specified, the default of <code>10000000</code> (10 million) will be used</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to enable notifications, you can either add these settings manually, or rename <code>config.yaml</code> and run <code>chia init</code>. A new copy of <code>config.yaml</code> will be created which contains the new settings.</p>
<p>Finally, you need to restart Chia for these settings to be picked up.</p>
<p>Note that for version 1.6.1, messages are sent and received via an RPC only. This is a primitive that will be added to the GUI in a future release. For more information on sending and receiving messages, see our <a href="/zh-Hans/wallet-rpc/#send_notification">RPC documentation</a>.</p>

<p>From the CLI, you can use the <code>chia wallet nft sign_message</code> command. See <a href="/zh-Hans/nft-cli/#sign_message">our CLI documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<p>From the GUI, you can sign and verify messages from the <code>ADVANCED</code> tab in the <code>Settings</code> section.

<p>A very high-end HDD <em>might</em> be fast enough, but we still recommend a $30 SSD, as stated above. It can be an external SSD, connected via USB. The database is always growing, but 256 GB should be sufficient until at least 1H 2024.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi 4 is supported, but Pi 3 is not. Here are the <a href="/zh-Hans/installation/#raspberry-pi">instructions</a>. This project requires a 64-bit OS. One can install and run harvesters, farmers, and full nodes on the Pi. Plotting on a Pi is feasible now with Chacha8 instead of AES, but the Pi isn&#x27;t quick. Modern desktops and laptops plot in the 0.07 - 0.10 GiB/minute range and the Pi 4 plots at 0.025 GiB/minute. Pi is also not a candidate for Timelords or VDF clients...</p>

<p>If you use the GUI, it will migrate from release to release for you. For both the GUI and the command line, your keys are stored on OS specific keychains. If running services from the command line only, <code>chia init</code> will migrate your config.yaml and dbs - if appropriate - to the new version. Keys and plots made before Beta 8 are deprecated and useless.</p>

<p>For power users, it is possible to <a href="/zh-Hans/installation/#from-source">install Chia from source</a>. In this case, you will run Chia from a virtual environment on the command line.</p>
<p>However, most users will prefer to download a packaged installer from Chia&#x27;s official <a href="https://www.chia.net/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download site</a>.</p>
<p>After installing with the packaged installer, you can run Chia from the command line by invoking the executable file. The easiest way to set this up is by running the <code>alias</code> command. The exact command needed depends on your OS:</p>

<p>By default, Chia will install <code>.crt</code> certificates in <code>~/.chia/mainnet/config/ssl</code>. If you are a .NET developer who is developing an application that connects to a full node, it is much easier to do this with <code>.pfx</code> certificates. This is because the TLS layer on Windows requires that the private key be written to disk (in a particular way). The PEM-based certificate loading doesn&#x27;t do that, only PFX-loading does.

<p>We plan to add <code>.pfx</code> certificates by default in a future version of Chia.

<p>No. Around the world, governments and banks cause problematic interactions that make banks difficult to trust, especially in volatile regions like Hong Kong, Venezuela Argentina or Lebanon. International payments, when they are available and work, are slow, expensive and insecure. International SWIFT wires often take 1-5 days. Correspondent banks often charge up to 3% and since the changes to banking since 9/11 and 2008, many countries have limited correspondent banks. International wire fraud losses are very large, and we have a better solution to mitigate these problems.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm
