A JBOD is typically made up of an enclosure, enclosure slots that identify each drive individually, a SAS expander and backplane, fans, and power supplies. All the disks in a JBOD can be accessed by a single SAS cable connected to a host server or desktop through a HBA (host bus adapter) which converts a PCIe slot to SAS.
