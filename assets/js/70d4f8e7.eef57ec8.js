The protocol for farming and harvesting was designed for quick and efficient verification of proofs of space while minimizing disk io (input/output). A harvester service checks plot files for partial proofs of space when a challenge is received. There is a plot filter designed to significantly reduce the amount of disk io required by requiring that a hash of the plot id and challenge contains a certain amount of zeros. We will explore the theoretical disk io requirements based on the protocols, and look at measured disk utilization during a real farming workload. The Chia farming workload differs from traditional enterprise or consumer storage use cases since the data stored in plot files contains no user data. The Chia farming workload is read-only, completely random distribution, and a low amount of data transferred between the device and host.

When a challenge arrives the plot filter is applied to reduce the disk io by the value of the plot filter constant, which is currently set to 512. The probability of a plot being accessed each challenge, which happens on the signage point interval time, is 1/512. The probability of an individual disk being accessed can be found with the binomial distribution function cumulative probability with a probability per plot, n trials equal to the number of plots on the disk (probability of X successes \u2265 1) per signage point. The amount of IOPS (input/output operations per second) can be estimated by determining the mean of the plot filter passes per day and multiplying by the number of seeks required for a proof quality check.

If the uncorrectable read error collides with a lookup for a partial proof of space, the farmer would fail that single request for a partial proof of space or proof quality check. This would lower the user's estimated capacity for a short duration, but then revert to the mean. In other words, an error in Chia farming is not catastrophic. Chia farming workload is a very good fit for a storage device with a higher error rate, potentially even with an UBER of greater than 10",(0,a.jsx)("sup",{children:"-13 "}),"."]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"summary",children:"Summary"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Chia is a light workload for a hard drive, 309 times lower disk busy time than an example hyperscale data center workload[2]. Plot files contain random cryptographic hashes that can easily be created and no user data, removing data durability requirements for data storage in Chia farming. Proof of space is a novel use case for hard drives and can accept storage media with a high UBER compared to typical consumer and enterprise workloads. Chia farming will constitute a new class of storage that is optimized for high capacity, write once / read many, low power, and high error rate. Chia farming is a great fit for hard drive technology optimized for sequential write only, such as SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording), and in the future NVMe ZNS (Zoned Name Spaces) paired with high capacity storage of a lower media grade. Chia farming would be an ideal use case for used storage, given the storage media is high enough capacity to maintain a competitive TCO compared to new more power-efficient disks."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"resources",children:"Resources"}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.ol,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.li,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/jesd218b01",children:"JEDEC "}),"JESD218B.01 SOLID STATE DRIVE (SSD) REQUIREMENTS AND ENDURANCE TEST METHOD"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.li,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/fast21-pan.pdf",children:"Facebook's Tectonic Filesystem: Efficiency from Exascale"})}),"\n"]})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},8251:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=r.p+"assets/images/bw-873a300af25d7147fb8dcb19f2979bb8.png"},3982:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=r.p+"assets/images/bw_drive-07b3cb42e0a93978256f609a441c466a.png"},8578:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=r.p+"assets/images/cpu-4d37c79ab38c06322e3cfacba6775ebe.png"},737:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=r.p+"assets/images/cpu1-88fa0b4b9b174a63da789a05aae7179b.png"},469:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=r.p+"assets/images/data_per_day-63d731accc72197842f1076e5f7c7b7b.png"},7209:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=r.p+"assets/images/disk_busy-30e336f99ead8b64b141c1435abdef53.png"},8165:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=r.p+"assets/images/iops-73e6fe55c4999e2d6839ddaa4017bddf.png"},3406:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=r.p+"assets/images/iosize_hist-190219243e9e76c2bc5bb8d9145983e7.png"},7710:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=r.p+"assets/images/latency-660c0a26ba53ce3873f0cf30ba293a4f.png"},5341:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=r.p+"assets/images/net-a524b6533296a516877749e576e4c0de.png"},398:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=r.p+"assets/images/prob_access-430f862506ceef20bba0cd6de8c9fea0.png"},6490:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{A:()=>i});const i=r.p+"assets/images/uber-09f9747bd8e9eb88c1981b038bafab88.png"},8453:(e,t,r)=>{r.d(t,{R:()=>n,x:()=>d});var i=r(6540);const a={},s=i.createContext(a);function n(e){const t=i.useContext(s);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function d(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:n(e.components),i.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
