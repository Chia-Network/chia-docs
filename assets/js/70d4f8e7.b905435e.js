The protocol for farming and harvesting was designed for quick and efficient verification of proofs of space while minimizing disk io (input/output). A harvester service checks plot files for partial proofs of space when a challenge is received. There is a plot filter designed to significantly reduce the amount of disk io required by requiring that a hash of the plot id and challenge contains a certain amount of zeros. We will explore the theoretical disk io requirements based on the protocols, and look at measured disk utilization during a real farming workload. The Chia farming workload differs from traditional enterprise or consumer storage use cases since the data stored in plot files contains no user data. The Chia farming workload is read-only, completely random distribution, and a low amount of data transferred between the device and host. Data durability (defined as the probability of not losing user data) and error rate requirements for Chia are significantly reduced compared to storing user data and may constitute a new class of storage media and promote used hardware that otherwise would not be suitable."),(0,n.kt)("h2",{id:"proof-of-space-verification"},"Proof of space verification"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"The proof of space construction and the ",(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"/proof-of-space"},"Proof of Space page")," contains the details on the format for plot files. A plot file size is determined by a k value where each plot is made up of 7 tables each with 2^k entries. When a challenge arrives the plot filter is applied to reduce the disk io by the value of the plot filter constant, which is currently set to 512. The probability of a plot being accessed each challenge, which happens on the signage point interval time, is 1/512. The probability of an individual disk being accessed can be found with the binomial distribution function cumulative probability with a probability per plot, n trials equal to the number of plots on the disk (probability of X successes \u2265 1) per signage point. The amount of IOPS (input/output operations per second) can be estimated by determining the mean of the plot filter passes per day and multiplying by the number of seeks required for a proof quality check. In the pooling protocol a pool operator requests several partial proofs of space per day per drive to verify that the pool participant is indeed storing as much data as they claim.

Chia farming is a great fit for hard drive technology optimized for sequential write only, such as SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording), and in the future NVMe ZNS (Zoned Name Spaces) paired with high capacity storage of a lower media grade.
