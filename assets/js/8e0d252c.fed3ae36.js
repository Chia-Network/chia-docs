This shift would allow for a more significant reduction in the plot filter, enhancing both grinding and compression resistance. The reduction in the plot filter is directly proportional to the increase in resistance, and we have up to ",(0,n.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"two additional orders of magnitude"})," available for tuning. This means the plot filter could eventually decrease from 256 to as low as 1, providing substantial flexibility to counter emerging risks while maintaining the integrity of the proof of space system."]})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},9329:(e,t,i)=>{i.d(t,{A:()=>a});i(6540);var o=i(4164);const n={tabItem:"tabItem_Ymn6"};var r=i(4848);function a(e){let{children:t,hidden:i,className:a}=e;return(0,r.jsx)("div",{role:"tabpanel",className:(0,o.A)(n.tabItem,a),hidden:i,children:t})}},5537:(e,t,i)=>{i.d(t,{A:()=>k});var o=i(6540),n=i(4164),r=i(5627),a=i(6347),s=i(372),l=i(604),h=i(1861),c=i(8749);function d(e){return o.Children.toArray(e).filter((e=>"\n"!==e)).map((e=>{if(!e||(0,o.isValidElement)(e)&&function(e){const{props:t}=e;return!!t&&"object"==typeof t&&"value"in t}(e))return e;throw new Error(`Docusaurus error: Bad <Tabs> child <${"string"==typeof e.type?e.type:e.type.name}>: all children of the <Tabs> component should be <TabItem>, and every <TabItem> should have a unique "value" prop.`)}))?.filter(Boolean)??[]}function p(e){const{values:t,children:i}=e;return(0,o.useMemo)((()=>{const e=t??function(e){return d(e).map((e=>{let{props:{value:t,label:i,attributes:o,default:n}}=e;return{value:t,label:i,attributes:o,default:n}}))}(i);return function(e){const t=(0,h.XI)(e,((e,t)=>e.value===t.value));if(t.length>0)throw new Error(`Docusaurus error: Duplicate values "${t.map((e=>e.value)).join(", ")}" found in <Tabs>.
