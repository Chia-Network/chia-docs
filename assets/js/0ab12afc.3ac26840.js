The minimum amount of storage needed to farm is only a single plot! Beginners should start with a few drives to make it worth running the farm, and earn a few dollars per month. You can you use your desktop computer to create the plots (see plotting). There are companies like Evergreen that make it one step easier and remove the plotting step by offering a pre-plotted drive and a mobile app. Plotting is going to be the limiting factor for curious farmers because their desktop or laptop may not have enough compute and temporary SSD storage that is suitable for plotting, but filling up a single drive with plots is fairly easy even for beginners."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)("img",{src:"https://www.chia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Hard-Drive-Standard.webp",width:"300"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(r.h2,{id:"hobbyist",children:"Hobbyist"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(r.p,{children:"Once you get to a few hundred terabytes, think about a dedicated desktop computer for Chia farming, a NAS, or an external storage enclosure.

Thankfully, data centers around the world have already engineered the best way to store an extremely large amount of storage in server racks. A serious farmer will be using JBODs. A JBOD, or "Just a bunch of disks" is a device dedicated to housing a large number of hard disk drives, and does not contain any integrated compute resources. A JBOD is typically made up of an enclosure, enclosure slots that identify each drive individually, a SAS expander and backplane, fans, and power supplies. All the disks in a JBOD can be accessed by a single SAS cable connected to a host server or desktop through a HBA (host bus adapter) which converts a PCIe slot to SAS. Serious farmers will put many of these JBODs in a rack to get extremely dense storage, which can achieve over 10 petabytes in a single rack using modern JBODs and high-capacity HDDs.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)("img",{src:"https://www.chia.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Rack-Scael-Edit-2.webp",width:"300"})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:r}={...(0,n.R)(),...e.components};return r?(0,a.jsx)(r,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},8453:(e,r,t)=>{t.d(r,{R:()=>i,x:()=>o});var a=t(6540);const n={},s=a.createContext(n);function i(e){const r=a.useContext(s);return a.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(r):{...r,...e}}),[r,e])}function o(e){let r;return r=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(n):e.components||n:i(e.components),a.createElement(s.Provider,{value:r},e.children)}}}]);
