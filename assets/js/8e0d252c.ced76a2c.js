However, these filters are not expected to vary on a timed schedule (we only propose changing them if/when needed, with plenty of advanced notice), so as a farmer you won\u2019t need to plan for any pre-scheduled dates where the filter will change. It is possible, if there are no longer any HDDs in use, we could propose a fork to alter the plot filter to improve resistance further since the restriction on seek times for HDDs would be lifted. Also, if GPU efficiency increases substantially in the future, to 10x or 100x what it is today, we can apply a soft fork to increase the plot difficulty \u2013 this would affect plot times and allow the phase-in of new plots that would be resistant to the hardware specifications at that future point in time. Note, however, that as cost per TB and also idle storage Watts also decreases over time, this counterbalances with GPU efficiency. So, while we may see 10x more efficient GPUs in 5 years, it does not necessarily mean we already need to adjust plot difficulty since the economics of farming on cheaper storage with extremely low idle power usage will also be a factor."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"how-many-times-will-i-have-to-replot",children:"How many times will I have to replot?"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Once for the foreseeable 5-year outlook, and possibly much longer.
