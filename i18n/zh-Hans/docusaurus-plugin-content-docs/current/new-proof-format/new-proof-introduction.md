## New Proof Format

In 2024 we announced that we were developing a new Proof of Space format. This is a long-term project which is not expected to be finalized until the end of 2026. All farmers will need to replot in the year leading up to that date. This will be a gradual process, so farmers will have plenty of time to plan ahead.

The documents in this section describe a technology that is still being developed. Everything you read here is subject to change.

While the development of this technology is ongoing, we have put together several documents to answer all of your questions:
