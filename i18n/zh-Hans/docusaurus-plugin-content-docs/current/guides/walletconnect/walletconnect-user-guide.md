## Intro

This guide will show you how to use [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/) to connect a sample dApp to your Chia reference wallet.

:::note a few notes

- Generally speaking, you only need to have a synced light wallet to use WalletConnect. A full node is not required. However, depending on your dApp, a full node may be required to run certain commands.
- WalletConnect is supported on every operating system supported by the Chia reference wallet, including Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
- WalletConnect is supported on Chia's testnet, as well as its mainnet.
- This guide will use Chia's reference wallet, but WalletConnect integration for other wallets will eventually be supported as well.

## Install the sample dApp

In order to help you get started with WalletConnect, we have created a sample dApp to run Chia wallet RPCs. In this section, we'll install and run the dApp locally. We'll also obtain a link to connect the dApp to a Chia reference wallet. In this section, we'll install and run the dApp locally. We'll also obtain a link to connect the dApp to a Chia reference wallet.

If you would like to connect your Chia reference wallet to a different dApp, then feel free to skip ahead to the [next section](#configure-walletconnect).

1. Run this command to clone the sample dApp's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Chia-Network/walletconnect-rpcs-dapp):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chia-Network/walletconnect-rpcs-dapp -b main
```

2. Change to the sample dApp's directory:

```bash
cd walletconnect-rpcs-dapp
```

3. Install the sample dApp using NPM:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the sample dApp:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Example result:

```bash
➜  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help
```

In this example, the dApp was started locally on port 5173. In this example, the dApp was started locally on port 5173. This is the default port; your dApp may need to use a different port if 5173 is already being used for something else.

5. Access the sample dApp:

Open a browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5173/](http://127.0.0.1:5173/) (unless a different port was used)

:::info

If you see an error message such as `An error as occurred`, the most likely cause is that you are running an ad blocker that is interfering with the dApp. Either disable the ad blocker or try a different browser.

## Configure WalletConnect

1. [Download and install](https://www.chia.net/downloads/) the latest version of Chia's reference wallet

2. Set up Chia's testnet

While it's possible to use WalletConnect on Chia's mainnet, this example will use the testnet. The primary command to convert your system to use the testnet is `chia configure -t true`. See our [testnet setup guide](/guides/chialisp-testnet-setup) for more info.

After your system has been configured to use the testnet, you can start your Chia reference wallet.

3. Click the WalletConnect icon

The icon is located on the upper-right side of the reference wallet GUI, as shown here:

  <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img
      src="/img/walletconnect/01_walletconnect.png"
      alt="Click the WalletConnect icon"
    />
  </div>

  <br />

4. Click `ENABLE WALLETCONNECT`

  <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img
      src="/img/walletconnect/02_walletconnect.png"
      alt="Click ENABLE WALLETCONNECT"
    />
  </div>

  <br />

5. Click `ADD CONNECTION`

  <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img
      src="/img/walletconnect/03_walletconnect.png"
      alt="Click ADD CONNECTION"
    />
  </div>

  <br />

6. Paste the link to your sample dApp and click `CONTINUE`

If you used this guide to set up the sample dApp, this was the link you obtained with the last step of the previous section:

  <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img src="/img/walletconnect/03_dapp.png" alt="Paste and click CONTINUE" />
  </div>

  <br />

7. By default, the wallet that is currently synced will be selected (in the red circle below). By default, the wallet that is currently synced will be selected (in the red circle below). Click the `Select Keys` dropdown if you want to connect other wallets, then click `CONTINUE`:

  <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img
      src="/img/walletconnect/04_walletconnect.png"
      alt="Select wallets and click CONTINUE"
    />
  </div>

  <br />

8. Confirm your connection

You will be shown the key(s) to connect to the dApp. If this looks OK, click `CLOSE`. To start over, click `DISCONNECT`:

  <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img src="/img/walletconnect/05_walletconnect.png" alt="Click CLOSE" />
  </div>

  <br />

9. Show more info

To show info on which dApp(s) are paired to which keys(s), click the WalletConnect icon, click the three dots, and click `More Info`:

  <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img src="/img/walletconnect/06_walletconnect.png" alt="Click More Info" />
  </div>

  <br />

You will be shown the Pair Information for your dApp:

  <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img
      src="/img/walletconnect/07_walletconnect.png"
      alt="Paired keys are showing"
    />
  </div>

  <br />

Your wallet has been successfully paired with the sample dApp. In the next section, we'll show you how to interact with your wallet from the dApp.

---

## Call dApp functions

1. View the sample dApp in a web browser

Recall that by default, the dApp will run on [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173).

You will be shown a dropdown list of available methods. You will be shown a dropdown list of available methods. The default method is `chia_logIn`, but we'll call a different method for this example.

  <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img src="/img/walletconnect/04_dapp.png" alt="Dropdown menu" />
  </div>

  <br />

2. Select `chia_getNextAddress`:

  <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img src="/img/walletconnect/05_dapp.png" alt="Run chia_getNextAddress" />
  </div>

  <br />

3. For this example, we will choose wallet ID `1` (the XCH wallet), and select `New Address`:

  <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img src="/img/walletconnect/06_dapp.png" alt="Wallet ID 1" />
  </div>

  <br />

4. Confirm the request

Switch back to your Chia reference wallet. You should now see a confirmation dialog with the requested method. Click `CONFIRM`:

  <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img src="/img/walletconnect/08_walletconnect.png" alt="Confirm request" />
  </div>

  <br />

5. View the response

Returning to the sample dApp, a new dialog with the response will appear. In this example, a new address will be shown:

  <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img src="/img/walletconnect/07_dapp.png" alt="Showing next address" />
  </div>

  <br />

You have now installed, configured, and used the sample dApp. Feel free to test the other functions, as well as create your own!

## Configure WalletConnect

By default, you can only run dApp methods against the wallet key that is currently synced. This was not an issue in the above example because we only selected one public key to pair with the sample dApp. However, if you want your dApp to be able to interact with multiple keys, you will need to enable an additional setting in the reference wallet.

Click the gear icon in the lower left corner of the reference wallet, then click the `INTEGRATION` tab. Two switches will appear at the top of this panel:

- `Enable WalletConnect` -- This setting was activated when you enabled WalletConnect earlier in the guide.
- `Key Switching` -- If you activate this setting, your dApp will be able to switch between multiple wallet keys. The selected wallet will need to sync whenever you switch between keys. The selected wallet will need to sync whenever you switch between keys.

  <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img
      src="/img/walletconnect/09_walletconnect.png"
      alt="Allow requests that require switching keys"
    />
  </div>

  <br />

To configure the commands that are provided to dApps, you can edit (locally) [chia-blockchain-gui/blob/main/packages/gui/src/constants/WalletConnectCommands.tsx](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain-gui/blob/main/packages/gui/src/constants/WalletConnectCommands.tsx). This file acts as a middle layer between the wallet and the dApp. It can also be used to control privacy settings.
