:::warning Coming Soon

Space Poker will be available in a future release. The rules below are based on current known game mechanics and may be subject to change.

:::

## Objective

Space Poker is a poker variant played with two simultaneous games. Players receive two hole cards with a boost bit (+ or -) that affects hand rankings. The goal is to win both games or maximize winnings across both games.

## Setup

- Each player receives two hole cards selected at random from 2-A (T=10, J=11, Q=12, K=13, A=14)
- Each hole card has a boost bit which is + or - with a ⅓ chance of being +
- Both players ante a minraise at the start of each hand
- All raise amounts are multiples of the minraise
- Two games proceed simultaneously until both are complete

## Hand Rankings

From lowest to highest:

1. **High Card**: No pair or better
2. **Pair**: Two cards of the same rank
3. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs
4. **Set (Three of a Kind)**: Three cards of the same rank
5. **Full House**: Three of a kind plus a pair
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards (no ace-to-five straight)
7. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank
8. **Five of a Kind**: Five cards of the same rank

**Important Differences from Traditional Poker:**

- **No Flushes**: Unlike traditional poker, there are no flushes in Space Poker
- **Five of a Kind**: This is the highest possible hand
- **No Ace-to-Five Straight**: The straight A-2-3-4-5 is not valid

## Tiebreakers

1. **Hand Type**: Higher hand type wins
2. **Boost Bit**: The boost bit is the first tiebreaker after hand type
3. **Standard Poker Tiebreaks**: After boost bit, standard poker tiebreaking rules apply

## Gameplay

### Turn Structure

- Players always alternate turns
- On your turn, you can either **call** or **raise**
- At the beginning of a street, calling doesn't end the street
- After the first action on a street, calling ends the street and causes a reveal of the next set of cards or showdown if it's on the river

### Streets

The game follows standard poker street structure:

- **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards
- **Flop**: First three community cards
- **Turn**: Fourth community card
- **River**: Fifth and final community card

### Showdown

- The player who made the final call reveals their hole cards first
- If the other player loses, they don't show their hole cards
- Winner is determined by hand rankings with boost bit tiebreaker

### All-In

If a player goes all-in:

- Wait for results to be collated
- This may be skipped if off-chain and happens fast enough

## Game Flow

1. **Two Simultaneous Games**: Play proceeds on two games simultaneously until both are done
2. **Player Actions**: On your turn, raise/call/fold. Hand history and current pot size are shown
3. **Wait for Opponent**: Wait for opponent to raise/call/fold
4. **All-In**: If applicable, wait for results to be collated
5. **Results**: Shows win/loss/split, amount won (if not a split), your hand if it got that far, and opponent's hole cards and hand if known
6. **Both Results Shown**: After both games complete, options to start new hands or end the session
7. **End Session**: Session may end due to:
   - Playing on-chain
   - Insufficient balance (yours or opponent's)
   - You or opponent declined to continue
