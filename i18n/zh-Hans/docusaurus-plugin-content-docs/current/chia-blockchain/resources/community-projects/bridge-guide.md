## Intro

A _cryptocurrency bridge_ is a powerful tool that enables seamless transfers of digital assets between different blockchain networks, breaking down the barriers of blockchain interoperability. The first Chia blockchain bridge by Warp.Green is now available, paving the way for anyone to access XCH.

As the first of many bridges to come, Warp.Green marks an exciting milestone in our journey toward greater access to chia (XCH). To help you get started, here's a introductory guide on how to use the Warp.Green bridge.

## The Warp.green Bridge

The [Warp.green bridge](https://www.warp.green/) is a messaging protocol that enables bridging assets between Chia and other blockchains. It is an open-source project located on [GitHub](https://github.com/warpdotgreen). It was developed by Warp.green, which is not affiliated with Chia Network Inc.

This guide will show you how to send ETH from the [Base](https://www.base.org/) blockchain (an Ethereum L2) to the Chia blockchain. The transfer will take a total of 15-20 minutes, though the initial setup could take considerably longer if you are not familiar with the technologies involved.

:::info

It is also possible to bridge assets from Ethereum to Chia, but we chose the Base chain for this guide because it tends to have lower fees.

In addition, it is possible to bridge assets in the other direction: from Chia to Ethereum/Base. This guide doesn't demonstrate this functionality, but the basic technique is quite similar.

Finally, note that the bridge is set up to allow for bridging _any_ Chia or Ethereum asset. However, only a limited number of assets are currently supported. A list of supported assets is maintained at [warp.green/bridge/assets](https://www.warp.green/bridge/assets).

:::

## Set up MetaMask

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) is one of the most popular wallets for storing digital assets such as ETH, and it supports the Base blockchain. We will use MetaMask for this guide, so if you want to follow along, you will need to install it as a web browser extension. But don't worry â€“ if you want to use a different Base wallet, the instructions will likely be similar.

After you have installed MetaMask, click the browser extension button ("1" in the following image), then click the dropdown to change blockchains ("2"):

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/01.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

By default, Ethereum's mainnet will be selected. The Warp.green bridge _will_ work with this network, but for this guide, we will use Base instead. Click `+ Add network`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/02.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Several supported networks will be displayed. Locate `Base Mainnet` and click `Add`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/03.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Verify that you are adding the correct network. The Chain ID for the Base mainnet is `8453`. Make sure this number is shown, and click `Approve`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/04.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

The network should be added successfully. Click `Switch to Base Mainnet`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/05.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

You will be given some important info about this network. Read this info carefully, then click `Got it`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/06.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

In order to use this wallet for the bridge, you will need to add funds. In this example, the MetaMask wallet was funded with 0.0057 ETH on the Base blockchain:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/07.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

After your Ethereum wallet has been funded, you can set up a Chia wallet.

## Set up a Chia wallet

While several Chia wallets exist, currently the bridge only supports wallets that use WalletConnect, as well as [Goby](https://www.goby.app/). For this example, we will use the Chia reference wallet. See our [wallet guide](/reference-client/getting-started/wallet-guide/#use-the-chia-wallet) for instructions on setting up this wallet.

You will need to add some XCH to the reference wallet in order to pay fees. In the image below, the wallet contains 0.001 XCH. Typically, this amount will be sufficient.

We're going to send a wrapped form of ETH to the Chia reference wallet. If you are using Chia 2.3.1 or later, your wallet will automatically recognize the wrapped ETH, but it's still a good idea to add this asset manually.

:::info

Regardless of which blockchain you are using, when you receive a bridged token, it will be a "wrapped" version of the native token. The Warp.green bridge calls its tokens "warped" instead of "wrapped". There is no material difference between these two terms; they can be used interchangeably.

:::

Click `MANAGE TOKEN LIST`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/08.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Locate `Base Warped milliETH` and click the slider to enable this asset. Feel free to double-check that the asset's ID matches the one from the [asset list](https://www.warp.green/bridge/assets) on Warp.green's website:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/09.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Your wallet will add `Base Warped milliETH`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/10.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

:::info

One `Base Warped milliETH` is the equivalent to 1/1000 of one ETH. This denomination was chosen due to the differences in decimals on Chia and Ethereum.

## Connect your wallets to the bridge

Using the same browser where you installed MetaMask, browse to [warp.green/bridge](https://www.warp.green/bridge). In order to use the bridge, you will need to connect both of your wallets.

### Connect your ETH wallet

Click `Connect ETH Wallet`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/11.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Click `MetaMask` (or whichever wallet you used on the Ethereum side):

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/12.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Select the account(s) you want to connect to the bridge. If you just installed MetaMask, there will only be one account. Click `Next`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/13.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Click `Connect` to connect your MetaMask wallet to the bridge:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/14.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Your MetaMask wallet is now connected to the bridge.

### Connect your Chia wallet

Click `Connect Wallet`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/15.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Click `Wallet Connect` if you are using the Chia reference wallet:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/16.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

You will be shown a QR code (not shown here). In this example, we'll click the `Copy Link` button.

Next, open your reference wallet, click the WalletConnect icon ("1" in the image below), then click `ADD CONNECTION` ("2"):

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/17.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Paste the link you previously copied, and click `CONTINUE`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/18.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Your Chia reference wallet will now be connected to the bridge. Click `CLOSE`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/19.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

The bridge will request an address from your wallet. It may perform other requests as well. Click `CONFIRM` for each request:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/20.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Return to your web browser. You should see `Connected` displayed under `Wallet Connect`. If so, you can close this dialog:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/21.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

## Initiate the transfer

The bridge will ask you to enter an amount to transfer. By default, the asset to transfer will be USDC. However, in this example, we will transfer ETH:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/22.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Enter the amount to transfer. Also, verify that the `From` and `To` chains are accurate. For this example, we will transfer 0.001 ETH from Base to Chia.

:::info

The Base blockchain will charge a fee, so you will not be able to send the full amount in your MetaMask wallet. In this example, 0.00000465 ETH was the required fee. This fee will vary, depending on which blockchain you are using, and how busy the network is.

:::

After you have verified this info, click `Bridge`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/23.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

In Step 1 of the transfer, you will be given one more chance to verify the accuracy of everything you have entered.

:::warning caution

Be sure to read this dialog carefully, and verify that all information contained within is accurate.

:::

:::note note on fees

Several fees may apply when using the bridge:

Each blockchain charges a fee to use its network. The size of each fee depends on how busy the network is, as well as how long you are willing to wait for your transaction to be confirmed. Generally speaking, the fees on Base are significantly lower than those on Ethereum. On Chia, the network is often not busy enough to require any fees.

In addition, a "toll" is automatically deducted for using the bridge. The toll is a small charge (either 0.001 XCH or 0.00001 ETH, depending on the chain where the transaction originated), collected solely to prevent network spam. This money does not go to the bridge or to its operators. Instead, it is redirected to the farmer/miner of the block which includes your transaction.

Finally, the bridge itself charges a 0.3% tip for using the protocol. This tip is split among the bridge validators and helps to cover the costs associated with maintaining the bridge.

For more information, see [warp.green's documentation](https://docs.warp.green/).

:::

If everything looks good, click `Initiate Bridging`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/24.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

MetaMask will pop up, and you will be shown the details of your transfer. This includes the current blockchain fee amount. Click `Confirm` to accept the fee and initiate the transfer:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/25.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

You will now be taken to Step 2 of the transfer. Before completing the transfer, you will need to wait around 10-15 minutes; the exact time can vary a bit. The reason for this delay is to avoid funds being lost in blockchain reorgs:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/26.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Leave this browser window open, and return to it after 15 minutes.

### Complete the transfer

After waiting for around 15 minutes, the transfer will reach Step 3. Click `Generate Offer via Wallet`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/27.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Change to your Chia reference wallet. You may see a dialog asking for permission to execute `getWallets`. If so, Click `CONFIRM`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/28.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

You may need to grant permission to execute one or more additional methods. Click `CONFIRM` on these dialogs. Eventually, you will see a dialog with a `SHOW OFFER DETAILS` button. Click this button:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/29.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

You will be shown the details of the transfer from the bridge to your wallet. By default, no blockchain fee will be used. However, if you have available funds (the small circle in the image below), we recommend that you add a fee in order to expedite the transfer. Either way, leave the `In exchange for` side of the dialog blank. Click `CLOSE` when you are finished reviewing this dialog:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/30.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

If you added a blockchain fee, it will now appear in the `Confirmation Request` dialog. Click `CONFIRM`:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/31.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Return to your web browser. The transfer will now be in progress. This should be completed in 1-5 minutes, depending on how busy the Chia network is, along with the size of your fee:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/32.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

After the transfer has completed, return to the reference wallet. It should now contain the `Base Warped milliETH`. In this example, the bridge charged a 0.3% fee, so 0.997 wmilliETH.b was transferred. Recall that this amount is worth 0.000997 ETH:

<p align='center'>
  <img alt='bridge' src='/img/bridge/eth_base_to_chia/33.png' width='800' />
</p><br/>

Congratulations! You have successfully transferred ETH from the Base chain to Chia. If you would like to exchange the wmilliETH.b for another asset, you could head to a decentralized exchange such as [dexie.space](https://dexie.space/), or an AMM such as [tibetswap.io](https://v2.tibetswap.io/).
