To create plots, you must have:

- **A farmer public key** -- created upon creating a new wallet
- **A pool public key** -- created upon creating a new wallet
- **A pool contract address** -- created upon creating a new plot NFT

This page will give a basic overview of how to obtain these values. This page will give a basic overview of how to obtain these values. For a detailed description, see the [Beginner's Guide to Farming](/farming-guide).

If you already have a wallet with a plot NFT, feel free to skip to the section for [CLI Plotting](#cli-plotting) or [GUI Plotting](#gui-plotting).

## Public Keys

### CLI

If you do not have a key/wallet, run the following command:

```bash
chia keys generate
```

You will be prompted to add a human-readable name to your wallet. This name is only used locally (it is not stored on the blockchain). If you do not enter a name, a number called a _fingerprint_ will be used instead. It is possible to change this name later. This name is only used locally (it is not stored on the blockchain). If you do not enter a name, a number called a _fingerprint_ will be used instead. It is possible to change this name later.

Example response:

```bash
Generating private key
Enter the label you want to assign to this key (Press Enter to skip): Test Wallet
Added private key with public key fingerprint 2225787457
```

In order to view your farmer public key, run `chia keys show`, optionally including the `-f <fingerprint>` flag to show only the info for the key you just generated:

```bash
chia keys show
```

The result will include the farmer public key and the pool public key. Make note of them for the subsequent steps. For example: Make note of them for the subsequent steps. For example:

```bash

### GUI

If you do not have a key, you will need to create one:

<div style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
  <img src="/img/how_to_plot/01.png" alt="Create a new wallet key" />
</div>

<br />

You will be presented with a list of twenty-four words. This is your wallet's recovery phrase. These words are all that are needed to recover your wallet on a new computer. Write them down and store them in a safe place. The order of the words is important. This is your wallet's recovery phrase.

You can also choose a custom name for your wallet. Click `NEXT` when you are finished. Click `NEXT` when you are finished.

## Pool Contract Address

In order to obtain a pool contract address, you will need to create a Plot NFT.

### CLI

First, you will need to decide whether to join a pool. For this example, we will use `-s pool` to join a pool. If you want to solo farm, use `-s local` instead. First, you will need to decide whether to join a pool. For this example, we will use `-s pool` to join a pool. If you want to solo farm, use `-s local` instead. (Later, you can change pools, using the plot NFT you are about to create.)

If you choose to join a pool, you will need to add the URL by adding the `-u` flag. For this example, we will join OpenChia, but there are many great pools to choose from. For a list of reputable pools, see [Chialinks.com](https://chialinks.com/pools/). (Chia Network, Inc. does not run a pool, and is not affiliated with OpenChia or Chialinks). For this example, we will join OpenChia, but there are many great pools to choose from. `Connect to pool` -- You will need to enter a valid pool URL. We will use OpenChia for this example, but there are many great pools to choose from. For a list of reputable pools, see [Chialinks.com](https://chialinks.com/pools/). (Chia Network, Inc. does not run a pool, and is not affiliated with OpenChia or Chialinks). (Chia Network Inc. does not run a pool, and is not affiliated with OpenChia or Chialinks).

Finally, you have the option of adding a blockchain fee with the `-m` flag. We will add a one-mojo fee for this example, which typically is sufficient to complete your transaction within a few minutes. We will add a one-mojo fee for this example, which typically is sufficient to complete your transaction within a few minutes.

In order to run this command, you will need to have one mojo in your wallet for the plot NFT, and one mojo for the blockchain fee.

For example:

```bash
chia plotnft create -s pool -u https://pool.openchia.io -m 0.000000000001
```

Creating a plot NFT requires an on-chain transaction that will cost one mojo. You are also recommended to enter a blockchain fee. Depending on how busy the network is, a one-mojo fee is typically enough to complete your transaction within a few minutes. You are also recommended to enter a blockchain fee.

## CLI Plotting

If you are unsure which plotter to use, the [Plotting Software](/plotting-software) page will help you to decide.

The [plotters CLI documentation](/plotters-cli) will guide you through using each of the plotters included with Chia. The basic commands to use are as follows: The basic commands to use are as follows:

#### BladeBit CUDA

**Be sure to add `--disk-128` if you have at least 128 GB of RAM, but less than 256 GB.** See the [plotters CLI documentation](/plotters-cli) for more details.

:::info

As of Chia 2.1, plotting with at least 16 GB of RAM (but less than 128 GB) is still experimental. A few notes: A few notes:

- The `--disk-16` option has been disabled in the Chia 2.1.0 release. This option has been disabled in the Chia 2.1.0 release. It is currently only available from the [standalone version](https://github.com/Chia-Network/bladebit/) of BladeBit.
- Plots created with this option on Linux with direct I/O disabled appear to work, but more testing is still needed.
- Plots created with this option on Windows are more likely to encounter issues.
- Be sure to check all plots created with this option, as they could be invalid even if the plotter appeared to succeed.
- **Use `--disk-16` at your own risk!**

:::

```bash
chia plotters bladebit cudaplot -d <destination dir> -f <farmer key> -p <pool key> -c <contract address> -n <number of plots> --compress <compression level>
```

#### BladeBit RAM

```bash
chia plotters bladebit ramplot -d <destination dir> -f <farmer key> -p <pool key> -c <contract address> -n <number of plots> --compress <compression level>
```

#### BladeBit Disk

```bash
chia plotters bladebit diskplot -t <temp dir> -d <destination dir> -f <farmer key> -p <pool key> -c <contract address> -n <number of plots> --compress 0
```

#### madMAx

```bash
chia plotters madmax -t <temp dir> -d <destination dir> -f <farmer key> -p <pool key> -c <contract address> -k <size> -n <number of plots>
```

#### ChiaPoS

```bash
chia plotters chiapos -t <temp dir> -d <destination dir> -f <farmer key> -p <pool key> -c <contract address> -k <size> -n <number of plots>
```

Regardless of which plotter you choose, it's a good idea to experiment with the optional parameters in order to optimize the plotting process for your hardware.
