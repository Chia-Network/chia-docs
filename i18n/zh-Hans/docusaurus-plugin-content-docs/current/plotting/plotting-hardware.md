## New proof format

In 2024, we proposed a new proof format. This format will have slightly different hardware requirements for plotting and farming versus the original format. For more info about the new format, see the following resources:

- [plotting requirements](/new-proof-plotting-requirements)
- [farming requirements](/new-proof-farming-requirements)
- [timeline](/new-proof-timeline)

The rest of this page only pertains to the original proof format.

## Cost/time tradeoffs

生成地块需要计算资源，计算资源越多，生成地块时间越快。 With that in mind, it may be tempting to run out and buy the fastest computer you can find for plotting. But first, you should consider a few important points, and answer some related questions: But first, you should consider a few important points, and answer some related questions:

- Most computers made within the last decade can be used to create Chia plots.
  - Do you already own a computer that is not being heavily used?
- Plotting is a one-time activity.
  - What will you do with your plotting machine after you have finished plotting?
- Farming is a long-term endeavor.
  - If you do buy a plotting computer, will the time saved on plotting justify its cost?

Everyone needs to decide for themselves what makes the most economic sense. With plotting, often it comes down a simple tradeoff of either: With plotting, often it comes down a simple tradeoff of either:

- Spend money on a computer, plot faster, and earn rewards sooner, or
- Don't spend money, plot slower, and earn rewards later

[ChiaCalculator.com](https://chiacalculator.com/) will help you to understand this tradeoff, along with more nuanced factors.

Many farmers find that they will make more money by using the equipment they already own.

If you do decide to buy hardware, this page will help you to decide what might work best for your farm.

When looking for a plotting machine, the main components to consider are the temporary storage and the processor type (CPU or GPU).

## Temporary storage

While a Chia plot is being created, a significant amount of temporary data must be written, either entirely in memory, or mostly on disk (HDD or SSD). There are tradeoffs to using RAM, HDDs, and SSDs for plotting, including durability, speed, and cost: There are tradeoffs to using RAM, HDDs, and SSDs for plotting, including durability, speed, and cost:

- **RAM**
  - Doesn't wear out from Chia plotting
  - Faster than SSDs; significantly faster than HDDs
  - Requires a high-end workstation or a server
  - **Typically only makes economic sense for large farms (>1 PiB)** <br/><br/>
- **HDD**
  - Doesn't wear out from Chia plotting
  - Significantly slower than RAM and SSDs
  - Works on most computers
  - **Cheap and effective for small farms (\<100 TiB), but typically too slow for larger farms** <br/><br/>
- **SSD**
  - Does wear out over time; a high-endurance enterprise NVMe SSD is recommended
  - Slower than RAM, but much faster than HDDs
  - Works on most computers
  - **A good option for farms of most sizes, especially if it means you don't have to buy a high-end workstation**

## Processor type

CPUs and GPUs are both supported for plotting, with GPUs typically being faster.

The **BladeBit CUDA** plotter requires an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA capability 5.2 and up, with at least 8GB of vRAM. It is supported on **Windows and Linux only.** MacOS support may be added in the future, but is not guaranteed.

:::note

`GPU + HDD` is not recommended. The HDD is already the bottleneck, even with CPU plotting. `GPU + HDD` is not recommended. The HDD is already the bottleneck, even with CPU plotting. Using a GPU with an HDD is not likely to improve plotting speed versus `CPU + HDD`.

:::info

[Gigahorse](https://github.com/madMAx43v3r/chia-gigahorse) from madMAx is a third-party plotter capable of creating compressed plots. Depending on your setup, it may be a viable option, but do keep in mind that this plotter carries a dev fee, as explained in the link.

If you want to create compressed plots, you will need to choose either `GPU + RAM`, `GPU + SSD`, or `CPU + RAM`. At some point, `CPU + SSD` might become capable of creating compressed plots as well, but for now this is not an option.

## Uncompressed plotters

Most Chia farmers will want to create compressed plots. However, some will opt for uncompressed plots, including those who: However, some will opt for uncompressed plots, including those who:

- Intend to keep their farm small
- Are not be primarily motivated by profit
- Do not want to spend any money on plotting hardware
- Pay a high amount for electricity, such that creating compressed plots is not economically justifiable

In these cases, and potentially others, most hardware running the ChiaPoS, madMAx, and BladeBit plotters will also work.
