NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, can be used to provide proof of ownership, handle licenses and royalties, and ensure uniqueness for digital entities and even real-world items.

0:20
Let's start at the basics. An item is non-fungible if it can not be interchanged for another identical item. For example, an original painting, a driver's license, or even a family heirloom. These items are unique and can't be substituted for something of "equal value" since any other item would not have the same properties.

0:40
Since digital items can be inherently duplicated, we need to pair the item with something that isn't. An NFT is a token on the blockchain that represents an item. This item could be physical and the NFT is a sort of registry of ownership on the blockchain, or the item could be digital, with the NFT serving as the non-interchangeable component.

NFTs can be used to provide ownership provenance, such as the sale and resale of digital art. They can also provide a mechanism of distributing royalties to the original author upon resale.

1:20
NFTs can also provide a method of verifying and transferring more ethereal concepts such as digital memberships and ecosystem specific assets.
It's an important point that just because something is non-fungible, it is not inherently valuable. For example, a family heirloom is non-fungible, and may have emotional value to one person,

but it does not have true value outside of a specific context. NFTs are a tool that is useful for providing a new way to work with digital items. They do not themselves create value.

## 常见问题

- **Size Limitations:** Because there is a limit to how large a single transaction can be, it is very rare to have the digital item itself embedded in the NFT. The token will instead contain a reference to the item that is hosted elsewhere.
- **NFTs are Data:** It is common to think of some type of image or art when thinking of NFTs. This is a very limited view. NFTs are essentially data objects that can contain references to other digital assets, or simply be the data object itself. The referenced asset may be a piece of digital art, but it could just as easily be a document, contract, application, etc.
