# 3.12 Light Clients

Light client support is another benefit of proof of space when compared with proof of stake, since all proofs can
be objectively verified cryptographically, 
and require controlling an actual resource at a certain point in time. With Chia consensus, a candidate chain can 
be compared to an alternate chain objectively for weight, even after being online for a long time, without relying on
a central authority.

For light clients who want to sync up quickly to the chain (for example mobile wallets),
a full node can create a small sized proof that can convince the light client that the weight of a chain is close to some value.
This is called a proof of weight.
Naively, the light client can download every single block and all the required proofs and verify them, but with such a large number of blocks,
this would require a lot of bandwidth and CPU.

A more efficient method relies on a protocol similar to Flyclient[4].
The node (prover) sends all the sub epoch summaries from the fork point,
which include difficulty resets, to the light client.
There is only one every 384 blocks, so this can only reach a few MB of data.
The node also deterministically samples several sub-epochs based on the challenge of the last block.
Sub-epochs have a chance to be chosen proportional to the difficulty during that sub-epoch.
For the chosen sub-epoch, the light client downloads one of the challenge chain blocks (which are approximately 1/32 of all blocks),
and computes the average infusion iterations of all challenge blocks in that sub-epoch.
Based on this time, the light client can extrapolate how many blocks the reward chain contains.
For example, if the challenge blocks all occur with very small iterations (close to the beginning of the slot),
there are likely many blocks in that slot.
Conversely, if the iterations are close to the middle of the slot, there is likely only one block per slot.
This allows the light client to only download 1/32 of the blocks in each slot, but still get a good estimate of the total weight.

Furthermore, the last few sub-epochs should be downloaded in full for the light client.
This adds a small amount of data, but prevents attackers from creating small forks at the end of the chain.
The main difference between this protocol and flyclient is that blocks are not committed to using a merkle mountain range,
but instead the light client downloads the entire list of sub-epoch hashes from genesis, guaranteeing that the queried sub-epochs are included in the chain.
Another difference is that entire sections are downloaded, as opposed to individual blocks.

More analysis needs to be done on how many sub-epochs should be downloaded and what the bounds are for what the proof of weight implies.


## Obtaining Transactions
Although this is described more in depth on other sections, light clients can fetch the transactions that they are
interested, without having to download every single block or block header. Two wallet protocols are available for this,
a less efficient one that maintains better privacy, and a super efficient one that has a privacy tradeoff, namely that
the wallet musk ask a node for payments made to certain addresses.
