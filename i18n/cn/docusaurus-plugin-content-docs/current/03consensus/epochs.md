# 3.11 时代和难度调整

> Epoch and Difficulty Adjustment

**Sub-epoch**：Sub-epoch N 在 sub-epoch N-1 结束时开始（第 0 个 sub-epoch 除外），并在第一个时隙的末尾结束，其中 384 * (N+1) 个块有自创世以来就被包括在内。

**Epoch**：Epoch N 在 epoch N-1 结束时开始（第 0 个 epoch 除外），并在第一个 slot 结束时结束，其中自创世以来已包含 4608 * (N + 1) 个块。

**难度**：一个常数，用于缩放给定空间证明的迭代次数。迭代计算为难度/质量。

每4608个区块，自动进行难度调整。这会修改两个参数：slot_iterations 参数和难度参数。

sub_slot_iterations 参数被重置，因此 300 秒的时隙需要接近 slot_iterations 的多次迭代。具体来说，重置是使用上一个时期的值来近似每秒迭代次数的比率。

我们将`epoch$`定义为从_prior_注入当前epoch的最后一个块开始，并以_in_当前epoch注入的最后一个块结束的时间段。因此，`epoch$` 是每个 epoch 发生的略微偏移的时期。

值`t1`、`i1` 和`w1` 表示`epoch$` 开头的时间戳、迭代（自创世以来）和权重（自创世以来）。同样，`(t2,i2,w2)` 是`epoch$` 末尾的值。

以下是我们计算每秒迭代次数的方法：

```python
iterations per second = floor(num iterations in last epoch / duration of last epoch) 
                      = floor(i2 - i1 / t2 - t1) 
```

也就是说，从 epoch 开始到结束的总迭代次数的 delta 除以时间戳中的 delta。

子时隙迭代次数是每十分钟子时隙的总迭代次数。
标牌点间隔迭代是子槽迭代除以 64（每个子槽的标牌点数）。

```python
sub slot iterations = iterations per second * 300
sp interval iterations = floor(sub slot iterations / 64)
```

请注意，我们并没有在 epoch 结束时准确地获取迭代和时间，而是在一个 epoch 中块的最后注入点（又名“epoch$”），原因很简单，我们只有当 块被注入。

```python
weight/sec of last epoch = (new weight - old weight) / duration of last epoch
                         = (w2 - w1) / (t2 - t1)

new difficulty = (weight/sec * target seconds) / target number of blocks
               = ((w2 - w1) / (t2 - t1) * (4608/64) * 300) / 4608
```

这可以重新排列以仅使用一个楼层划分：

```python
new difficulty = floor(75 * (w2 - w1) / (16 * (t2 - t1)))
```

调整子时隙迭代，使得每个时隙持续大约 600 秒。
调整难度使得每个挑战平均获得 32 个块，迭代次数少于 slot_iterations。

需要注意的是，每个槽的 VDF 迭代次数与权重无关。
也就是说，如果有两个相同的世界，其中 VDF 速度相等，空间相等，但是一个世界中子槽迭代参数是两倍高，那么子槽迭代次数较高的区块链将获得两倍多的块 每个插槽都包含在内，但每个插槽需要两倍的时间。 在这两种情况下，每秒添加到链上的重量是相同的。

另一种看待它的方式是增加子槽迭代增加每个槽的块数，但它也使槽持续时间更长，因此对每秒权重没有影响。

**Sub-epoch**: Sub-epoch N starts when sub-epoch N-1 ends (except for 0th sub-epoch), and it ends at the end of the first slot where 384 * (N+1) blocks have been included since genesis. 

**Epoch**: Epoch N starts when epoch N-1 ends (except for 0th epoch), and it ends at the end of the first slot where 4608 * (N + 1) blocks have been included since genesis.

**Difficulty**: A constant that scales the number of iterations for a given proof of space. Iterations are computed as difficulty / quality. 

Every 4608 blocks, the difficulty adjustment is automatically performed. This modifies two parameters: The slot_iterations parameter, and the difficulty parameter. 

The sub_slot_iterations parameter is reset so a 300-second slot requires close to slot_iterations many iterations. The reset is done using the values from the last epoch to approximate the iterations-per-second ratio, concretely.

We'll define `epoch$` as the period beginning with the last block that was infused _prior_ to the current epoch, and ending with the last block that was infused _in_ the current epoch. Thus, `epoch$` is a slightly shifted period that occurs for each epoch. 

The values `t1`,`i1` and `w1` denote the timestamp, iterations (since genesis), and weight (since genesis) at the beginning of `epoch$`. Along the same lines, `(t2,i2,w2)` are the values at the end of `epoch$`.

Here's how we calculate iterations per second:

```python
iterations per second = floor(num iterations in last epoch / duration of last epoch) 
                      = floor(i2 - i1 / t2 - t1) 
```

That is, the delta in total iterations from the start to the end of the epoch, divided by the delta in timestamps.

Sub-slot iterations is the total number of iterations per ten-minute sub-slot.
Signage point interval iterations is sub-slot iterations divided by 64 (the number of signage points per sub-slot).

```python
sub slot iterations = iterations per second * 300
sp interval iterations = floor(sub slot iterations / 64)
```

Note that we don’t take the iterations and time exactly at the end of an epoch, but at the last infusion point of a block in an epoch (aka `epoch$`), the reason being simply that we only have timestamps available when blocks are infused.

```python
weight/sec of last epoch = (new weight - old weight) / duration of last epoch
                         = (w2 - w1) / (t2 - t1)

new difficulty = (weight/sec * target seconds) / target number of blocks
               = ((w2 - w1) / (t2 - t1) * (4608/64) * 300) / 4608
```

This can be rearranged to use only one floor division: 

```python
new difficulty = floor(75 * (w2 - w1) / (16 * (t2 - t1)))
```

The sub-slot iterations are adjusted such that each slot lasts around 600 seconds.
The difficulty is adjusted such that every challenge gets 32 blocks on average with fewer iterations than slot_iterations.

It is important to note that the VDF iterations per slot is not material to the weight.
That is, if there were two identical worlds where VDF speeds were equal and space was equal, but the sub-slot iterations parameter was twice as high in one world, then the blockchain with the higher sub-slot iterations would get twice as many blocks included per slot, but each slot would take twice as long. The weight per second added to the chain would be the same in both cases.

Another way to look at it is that increasing sub-slot iterations increases the number of blocks per slot, but it also makes slots last longer, and thus has no effect on weight per second.

## 子时代

如[第 3.8 节](/docs/03consensus/three_vdf_chains "Section 3.8: Three VDF Chains")中所述，挑战链是完全独立的，不涉及奖励链中的任何内容。如果这些链永远分开，拥有更快 VDF 的攻击者将能够展望遥远的未来并预测挑战。攻击者可以在空间有限的情况下为每个插槽创建一个区块，从而创建一个完整的挑战链。这将允许他们创建情节并立即为这些将来获胜的情节创建空间证明，然后删除这些情节（远程重新绘制攻击）。这将使他们能够填补他们的奖励链并增加他们的体重。
 
对此的解决方案是定期（每 384 个区块，平均 2 小时）将奖励链注入挑战链。这意味着攻击者只能在未来几个小时内执行重新绘制攻击。绘制需要一些时间，但即使攻击者可以立即重新绘制，重新绘制攻击的成本也将超过收益。这是因为我们没有注入 _current_奖励链输出；相反，我们注入 _previous_ 子时代的奖励链输出（过去两个小时）。

创建图的成本包括计算所有表的电力、创建该图所需的 RAM 以及固定基础设施成本（空间、电力、冷却等）。假设最坏的情况是超快速 VDF 和即时 ASIC 绘图 - 其好处将等同于将该绘图存储在 HDD 上几个小时的好处。请注意，这并不能保证获胜的情节；这相当于存储一个正常的图。

很明显，这种攻击是不值得的，而且存储这些图要便宜得多。这在[第 3.14 节](/docs/03consensus/attacks_and_countermeasures#short-range-replotting-attack "Section 3.14: Short Range Replotting Attack")中有更详细的讨论。

以上解释了为什么子纪元间隔应该保持相对较低。但是为什么我们不能进一步将其减少到 2 小时以下以进一步抑制重新策划攻击？原因是，每当将非规范数据注入挑战链（奖励链包含的内容，请参阅 [第 3.10 节](/docs/03consensus/foliage "Section 3.10: Foliage")了解更多信息）时，就有机会磨砺发生。这意味着攻击者可以选择包含或排除块来操纵未来 2 小时的挑战。如果这个时间太短，他们可以通过更频繁地这样做来获得小空间优势。

sub-epochs 的第二个（也是完全独立的）目的是在 [Section 3.12](/docs/03consensus/light_clients "Section 3.12: Light Clients")中解释的类似 Flyclient 的协议中充当检查点，以提高效率轻客户端。

- ## Sub epochs

As described in [Section 3.8](/docs/03consensus/three_vdf_chains "Section 3.8: Three VDF Chains"), the challenge chain is completely separate and does not refer to anything in the rewards chain. If these chains stayed separate forever, an attacker with a faster VDF would be able to look into the far future and predict challenges. The attacker could create one block per slot, with limited space, thus creating a whole challenge chain. This would allow them to create plots and instantly create proofs of space for these plots that will win in the future, and then delete the plots (a long range replotting attack). This would enable them to fill their reward chain and increase their weight. 
 
The solution to this is to periodically (every 384 blocks, which is an average of 2 hours) infuse the reward chain into the challenge chain. This means that the attacker can only perform the replotting attack for a few hours into the future. Plotting takes some time, but even if the attacker could replot instantly, the cost of a replotting attack will outweigh the benefits. This is because we do not infuse the _current_ reward chain output; instead we infuse the _previous_ sub-epoch's reward chain output (two hours in the past).

The cost of creating a plot includes the electricity to calculate all of the tables, the RAM necessary while creating this plot, and the fixed infrastructure costs (space, power, cooling, etc). Assuming the worst case scenario of a super fast VDF, and instant ASIC plotting - the benefits would be equivalent to the benefits of storing that plot on a HDD for a few hours. Note that this would not guarantee a winning plot; it would be the equivalent of storing a normal plot.

It is clear that this attack is not worthwhile, and that storing the plots is much cheaper. This is discussed in further detail in [Section 3.14](/docs/03consensus/attacks_and_countermeasures#short-range-replotting-attack "Section 3.14: Short Range Replotting Attack").

The above explains why the sub-epoch interval should be kept relatively low. But why can’t we further reduce it to lower than 2 hours to further disincentivize replotting attacks? The reason is that whenever non-canonical data is infused into the challenge chain (which the reward chain contains, see [Section 3.10](/docs/03consensus/foliage "Section 3.10: Foliage") for more info), an opportunity for grinding occurs. This means an attacker can possibly choose to include or exclude blocks to manipulate what the challenge will be 2 hours into the future. If this time is too short, they can gain a small space advantage by doing this more often.

The second (and completely separate) purpose for sub-epochs is to act as checkpoints in a Flyclient-like protocol explained in [Section 3.12](/docs/03consensus/light_clients "Section 3.12: Light Clients"), to increase the efficiency of light clients.
