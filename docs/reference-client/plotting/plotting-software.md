Several Chia plotters are now available. The output (a plot) will be nearly identical for a given k-value and compression level. However, the hardware requirements are different for each plotter.

The four families of plotters include:

- BladeBit -- developed by Chia Network Inc.
- DrPlotter -- developed by DrNick and supported by Chia Network Inc.
- madMAx -- developed external to CNI
- ChiaPoS -- the original plotter, developed by CNI

This page provides details about the plotters that exist within each of these families.

- Can also be installed as a [standalone build](#bladebit-standalone)
- A detailed analysis of BladeBit CUDA's performance was undertaken by [scienceofmining.com](https://scienceofmining.com/20230828-BladeBit/BladeBit%20CUDA%20Performance%20Analysis-1.html)

[CLI documentation](/reference-client/cli-reference/plotter-cli#cudaplot)

**Example command**

The following command will create a single plot with a compression level of 7. It will use the specified keys and contract address in case the farmer is located on a different machine. It will use the defaults for the remaining parameters:

```bash
chia plotters bladebit cudaplot -d <destination dir> -f <farmer key> -p <pool key> -c <contract address> -n 1 --compress 7
```

[CLI documentation](/reference-client/cli-reference/plotter-cli#diskplot)

**Example command**

The following command will create a single uncompressed plot (plot compression is disabled in Chia version 2.0.0). It will use the specified keys and contract address in case the farmer is located on a different machine. It will allocate 32 GB of DRAM cache, and it will use the specified temporary drive (typically an SSD) and destination drive. It will use the defaults for the remaining parameters:

```bash
chia plotters bladebit diskplot -t <temp dir> -d <destination dir> -f <farmer key> -p <pool key> -c <contract address> --cache 32G -n 1 --compress 0

**Complete instructions** for downloading and installing BladeBit are available on the [BladeBit GitHub page](https://github.com/Chia-Network/bladebit/).

Abbreviated installation instructions:

1. Install [cmake](https://cmake.org)
2. Clone BladeBit:

```
git clone https://github.com/Chia-Network/bladebit.git && cd bladebit
```

3. Create and enter a build directory:

```
mkdir -p build && cd build
```

4. Generate config files:

```
cmake ..
```

5. Build BladeBit:

```
cmake --build . --target bladebit --config Release
```

After the installation has completed, the `bladebit` command will be available from the `Release` directory. For example, to obtain a list of options, run:

```
./Release/bladebit -h
```

## Choosing a plotter

With so many plotters available, the decision of which one to choose may seem daunting. However, your hardware setup will often make the choice for you. If you have:

- At least 256 GB of RAM **and** a CUDA-class GPU with at least 8 GB of VRAM
  - You will likely want BladeBit CUDA
  - Gigahorse will also work
  - Other plotters will under-perform
- At least 16 GB of RAM (experimental) or at least 128 GB, but less than 256 GB **and** a CUDA-class GPU with at least 8 GB of VRAM, **and** a 256 GB or larger SSD (ideally enterprise NVMe)
  - You will likely want BladeBit CUDA
  - Gigahorse will also work
  - Other plotters will under-perform
- 416 GB of RAM but no GPU
  - BladeBit RAM is easily your best choice
- Less than 16 GB of RAM and don't mind creating uncompressed plots
  - BladeBit Disk and madMAx are both good options

It is always possible, and indeed recommended, to create a plot with a few different plotters to understand how well your system will perform. Once you have a feel for using the different plotters, you can begin plotting in earnest.

---

## CLI usage

There is a new `chia` command for creating plots called `plotters`. For compatibility, the original command for creating plots `chia plots create` remains in place, however, this will always use the reference ChiaPoS plotter. In order to use the other plotters, you must use the new `chia plotters` command. Command line options differ with each plotter, so be sure to check the available options using `chia plotters <plotter> -h` or by reading the online [CLI documentation](/reference-client/cli-reference/plotter-cli). Available plotter values include "chiapos", "bladebit", and "madmax".

The UI also has new functionality to support selecting a plotter.

Note: Not all features are available for every plotter.
