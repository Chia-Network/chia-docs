## How to tell if Chia Farming is Working?

When you are first operating Chia and wondering if the software is working, here are some tips to keep you sane.

First off, you'll want to have your configuration set up to do additional logging. The configurations can be found in `config.yaml`. This file is located in `chia/mainnet/config.yaml`.

The location of the `.chia` folder varies, On windows you'll want to look in `C:/Users/your username)/.chia/mainnet/config.yaml`. On Mac, this file is located in `/Users/(your username)/.chia/mainnet/config/config.yaml`.

Shut down Chia before config access. Open `config.yaml` and edit the first `log_level`, setting it `INFO` instead of `WARNING`. Save the file.

Now, you can relaunch Chia. Give it 20 minutes to run.

Opening the log file while Chia is running, you'll see additional messages. You can find `debug.log` in the `log` directory right next to `config` directory accessed earlier.

Log files are very informative. Once a log fills to 20mb another is created. If there are too many you can delete some of them.

Inside what you are looking for are these lines:

```
_07:02:41.663 harvester src.harvester.harvester : INFO 1 plots were eligible for farming f53c496e80... Found 0 proofs. Time: 0.00500 s. Total 8 plots_
```

This means Chia is working. The filter system is 2 parts. Chia found that 1 plot passed the first part, now it looks inside to determine if a pre-formulated "proof" will be able to do a transaction in the fastest time (2-3 seconds). If it secures one in your plot, you win. Many times it will say 0 proofs. But it shows it's working. This is where luck/time comes into play. At the end of that line it will indicate how many plots the software registers.

Another way to ensure your farm is operational is checking against a pool. Consistent payouts from regulary partials sent gives you peace of mind. This is opposed to solo farming where you may need to wait days, weeks, or months for a win, the whole time wondering if it truly is set up right.

## What is Normal Information in a Log File?

Below is a copy of normal information from a log file:

---

_9:32:00.322 full_node full_node_server : INFO \<- new_signage_point_or_end_of_sub_slot from peer 68b376e5846696df3510822ea527d0899ac6183f261e8858119235cd24903720 193.91.103.92._-

_09:32:08.211 harvester src.harvester.harvester : INFO 0 plots were eligible for farming fec1fff66e... Found 0 proofs. Time: 0.00200 s. Total 8 plots._

---

The last line shows at that current time of 09:32:08.211 8 plots were farming and 0 plots were eligible. It still means the software recognized the plots and is farming.
