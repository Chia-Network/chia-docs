# Proof of Space

A proof of space protocol is one in which:
a Verifier can send a challenge to a Prover, and 
the Prover can demonstrate to the verifier that the Prover is reserving a specific amount of storage space at that precise time. 

The proof of space protocol has three components: plotting, proving/farming, and verifying.
Details of the chiapos specification are [here](https://www.chia.net/assets/Chia_Proof_of_Space_Construction_v1.1.pdf), and reference implementation [here](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chiapos).

## Plotting 
Plotting is the process by which a prover, who we refer to as a farmer, initializes a certain amount of space. A farmer can be any person who has at least 100 GiB available to reserve on their laptop, or an enterprise prepared to allocate a large volume of unused storage space.
There is no upper limit. Plotting takes on the order of hours or days, and is performed only once.
The initialized space is occupied by a file called a plot. Plot sizes are determined by a k parameter, where `space = 780 * k * pow(2, k - 10)`, with a minimum k of 32 (101.4 GiB).
As of Chia 1.2.7, a k32 plot can be created in around 5 minutes if you have 400 GiB of ram, six hours with a normal commodity machine, and 12 hours with a slow machine using one CPU core and a few GB of memory.
There are opportunities for huge speedups. The PosSpace construction is based on Beyond Hellman [8], but is nested 6 times and contains other heuristics to make it practical.

The result is a plot file that can be, for example, 100 GiB. The file contains seven tables with random-looking data.
Each table has 2^k entries. Each entry in table i contains two pointers to table i-1 (the previous table).
Finally, each table 1 entry contains a pair of integers between 0 and 2^k, called “x-values.” A proof of space is a collection of 64 x-values that have a certain mathematical relationship.
The actual on disk structure and the algorithm required to generate it are quite [complicated](https://www.chia.net/assets/Chia_Proof_of_Space_Construction_v1.1.pdf), but this is the general idea.

In the diagram above, once the Prover has initialized 100 GiB, they are ready to receive a challenge and create a proof. One attractive property of this scheme is that it is non-interactive: no registration or online connection is required to create a plot. Nothing hits the blockchain until a reward is won, similar to PoW.


## Farming
Farming is the process by which a farmer receives a sequence of challenges to prove that they have legitimately put aside a defined amount of storage. In response to each challenge the farmer checks their plots, generates a proof and submits any winning proofs to the network for verification. 

Each iteration of this process is a table lookup. A lookup takes a 256 bit challenge as input and outputs a proof. The farmer responds to a challenge by reading a pair of values in table 7. These point to two entries in table 6, etc. Finally, the farmer fetches the whole tree of x-values. This requires one read for table 7, two for table 6, four for table 5, etc. The whole process would take approximately 640ms, assuming a slow HDD with a 10ms seek time. The amount of data read is small and is independent of plot size.

Since most proofs generated by this process are not good enough (as discussed later) to be submitted to the network for verification, we can optimize this process by only checking one branch of the tree, which results in two x-values, depending on the challenge. We then hash the x-values generated in this way into a 256 bit string to determine whether the proof is good. Hashing these x-values gives us the quality string, a 256 bit random value. This is combined with the difficulty and the plot size to generate the required_iterations. If the required_iterations is less than a certain number (we can get into the blockchain), then we look up the whole PoSpace. Looking up one branch requires only around 7 disk seeks and reads or about 70ms on a slow hard drive. 
Figure 2: Structure of a plot file. The 64 red x- values represent the proof, the 2 green x- values represent the quality. 

A further optimization is to disqualify a certain proportion (for example 511/512) plots from eligibility for each challenge. This is referred to as the plot filter. For example, requiring that the hash of the challenge and the plot_id starts with 9 zeros. This hurts everyone equally (except for replotting attackers), and is therefore fair. This makes farming require almost no resources, and very few disk reads every few minutes.  Chia users have successfully been farming multiple PiB of storage on a single Raspberry Pi. We assume that farmers always use HDDs since they are cheap and there is no reason to use SSDs since the speed is not relevant for farming. SSDs / RAM can be used for faster plotting, however. 

The plot key is a private key that is stored in the plot file. The plot id is generated by hashing the plot public key and the pool public key. Creating a block with a proof of space requires signing with both the plot key and the pool key. Therefore the pool may not be changed after creating the plot. In practice, the plot key is a 2/2 BLS aggregate public key between a local key stored in the plot and a key stored by the farmer software. For security and efficiency a farmer may run a centralized server using this key and signature scheme. The server may be connected to many harvester machines that store plots. Farming requires the farmer key and the local key, but does not require the pool key, since the pool’s signature can be cached and reused for many blocks.



## Verifying
After the farmer has successfully created a proof of space, the proof can be verified by performing a few hashes and making comparisons between the x-values in the proof. Recall that the proof is a list of 64 x-values, where each x-value is k bits long. For a k32 this is 256 bytes, and is therefore very compact. Verification is very fast, but not quite fast enough to be verified in solidity on ethereum (something that would enable trustless transfers between chains), since it requires blake3 and chacha8 operations.
