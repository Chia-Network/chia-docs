  <summary>Note about Python <code>RuntimeError</code> on Windows</summary>

If you are running on Windows, you might occasionally see a Python Runtime Error. This is a [known issue in Python](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/4324 "More info about this issue") and can be safely ignored. For example:

```powershell
chia stop -d all

## Install and configure Chia

This section will show you how to download and install Chia from the `release/1.4.0` branch, configure your installation to run on the testnet, sync your node, and obtain some TXCH. If you have already done all of these things, you can skip to the next section, [Create an NFT wallet (CLI)](#create-an-nft-wallet-cli "Create an NFT wallet (CLI)").

:::tip
Your firewall might give warnings when installing Chia. This is normal. Allow the installations to continue.
:::

1. We'll be running on Chia's testnet. If you don't have a synced testnet node, you can safely download a copy of the database. **Do not attempt this on mainnet.** [Click here to begin the download.](https://download.chia.net/testnet10/blockchain_v2_testnet10.sqlite.gz "Chia's testnet10 database download site") Save the file to your Downloads folder.

  :::note
  The file you will download is around 15 GB, compressed. Uncompressed, it will be around 30 GB. Make sure you have at least this much free space, and ideally 50 GB.
  :::

  You may continue with the next steps while the download is in progress.

2. If Chia is already installed on your system, make sure it is stopped:
  ```bash
  chia stop -d all
  ```
  Ensure there are no `chia` related processes running. If you are unsure, you may want to uninstall Chia before continuing.

3. The code to be released in version 1.4 (including NFTs and DIDs) is in the [release/1.4.0](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/tree/release/1.4.0 "release/1.4.0 branch") branch of the `chia-blockchain` repository. You'll need to download this branch.

  :::note
  If you don't already have the `git` CLI tool installed, [follow these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install it
  :::

  Create a new directory and download the `release/1.4.0` branch of the `chia-blockchain` repository into it:
  ```powershell
  mkdir 1_4_0
  cd 1_4_0
  git clone -b release/1.4.0 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain.git
  ```
  
4. Install Chia:

:::info
If, rather than following the steps from this tutorial, you want to run a binary Chia installer, here's how to set an alias and switch to using the testnet:

Windows:

  * From a powershell window, run `Set-Alias -Name chia C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\chia-blockchain\app-<version>\resources\app.asar.unpacked\daemon\chia.exe`. Be sure to update [username] and [version] to match the actual folder structure. This will allow you to run the `chia` command as you would in a virtual environment
  * Run `chia configure -t true`. This will swith your configuration to run the testnet

MacOS:

  * From a terminal window, run `alias chia='/Applications/Chia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/daemon/chia'`. This will allow you to run the `chia` command as you would in a virtual environment
  * Run `chia configure -t true`. This will swith your configuration to run the testnet

  ```

:::tip
  If you receive the message `WARNING: UNPROTECTED SSL FILE!` then run:
  ```powershell
  chia init --fix-ssl-permissions
  ```
:::

5. Check the version of the Chia software:
  ```bash
  chia version
  ```
  For example, as of writing the current version is:
  ```text
  1.3.6.dev565
  ```

6. **IMPORTANT:** Run the following command to set up Chia to use the testnet:
  ```bash
  chia configure --testnet true
  ```

7. We recommend that you use `INFO` level logging instead of the default `WARNING` level. To do this, run:
  ```bash
  chia configure --set-log-level INFO
  ```

8. We recommend that you use a public/private key pair for testnet that is separate from your mainnet keys. If you don't have a separate set of testnet keys, generate them:

  ```bash
  chia keys generate
  ```
  This will give an output such as the following:
  ```bash
  Generating private key
  Added private key with public key fingerprint 3049838316
  (...)
  ```

  :::tip
  It is good security practice to use this set of keys for testnet development only. In case of key compromise, your TXCH and NFTs will be sandboxed from your XCH.
  :::

9. If you generated new testnet keys in the last step, we recommend that you write down your seed phrase for later recovery. Run the following: 

  ```bash
  chia keys show --show-mnemonic-seed
  ```

  You'll be shown your public and private keys. The last line of the output will be a list of 24 secret words. This is your _seed phrase_. **Carefully copy the words on paper and store them in a secure location.** Order is important.
  ```text
  Showing all public and private keys

  Fingerprint: 3049838316
  (...)
	Mnemonic seed (24 secret words):
  youth stomach social aware clay pottery benefit asthma mail cry rubber panda wife around provide atom cute sand staff exotic pink east gloom minute
  ```

  :::warning important
  Your seed phrase is all that is required to recover your wallet. If you lose your seed phrase, recovery will not be possible. If a bad actor gains access to your seed phrase, they'll be able to steal your Chia assets, including XCH, CATs and NFTs.
  :::

  :::info
  If you ever need to display your address, run `chia keys show`. This command will only output your public keys and address; your private keys and seed phrase will not be shown.
  :::

10. Start your wallet by running:

  ```bash
  chia start wallet
  ```

11. Wait for your wallet to sync. You can view the status of your wallet with the following command:

  ```bash
  chia wallet show
  ```

  Be sure to select the correct key/fingerprint, which you obtained from the `chia keys show` command:

  ```text
  Wallet keys:
  1)   285637561
  2) * 3049838316 (Not Synced)
  Choose a wallet key [1-2] ('q' to quit, or Enter to use 3049838316):
  Wallet height: 938814
  Sync status: Syncing...
  ```

  Syncing should only require a few minutes, unless your wallet has a large number of previous transactions. Eventually, the `chia wallet show` command will show that your wallet has been synced:

  ```text
  Wallet height: 938990
  Sync status: Synced
  Balances, fingerprint: 3049838316

  Chia Wallet:
     -Total Balance:         14.5 txch (14500000000000 mojo)
     -Pending Total Balance: 14.5 txch (14500000000000 mojo)
     -Spendable:             14.5 txch (14500000000000 mojo)
     -Type:                  STANDARD_WALLET
     -Wallet ID:             1
  ```

12. In order to continue, you'll need to have some TXCH in your wallet. If your total balance is 0, you can obtain 1 TXCH from our faucet. Copy the value of "First wallet address:" from the output of the `chia keys show` command. It will be a long string beginning with "txch". 

  Open our [testnet faucet page](https://testnet10-faucet.chia.net "Chia's testnet10 faucet link"). Paste your address and click "Submit".

  You'll receive this message: `Accepted. Your request is in the queue and will be processed in the order it was received.` At some point you'll receive 1 TXCH. Depending on how busy the faucet and the testnet are, this could take several minutes. However, you don't need to wait for your coins to arrive before continuing.

13. Create the folder where your database will reside:

	```bash
	mkdir ~/.chia/mainnet/db
	```

14. You must wait for your database file to finish downloading before continuing. After the download has completed, use an archive manager such as [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/ "7-Zip's website") to extract the file. You should now have a file in your Downloads folder called `blockchain_v2_testnet10.sqlite`.

 Move the database to the folder you just created:
 ```bash
 mv ~/Downloads/blockchain_v2_testnet10.sqlite ~/.chia/mainnet/db
 ```

15. Start the full node, which will begin syncing to the database file:

  ```bash
  (venv) $ chia start node
  chia_full_node: started
  ```

16. Check the sync status:

  ```bash
  chia show -s
  ```

  Eventually, it will say `Full Node Synced`:
  ```text
  Network: testnet10    Port: 58444   RPC Port: 8555
  Node ID: 82a73b06b3a5f9493a3ac4e3d903026b39c85b748158ba41c623d531947f2a2a
  Genesis Challenge: ae83525ba8d1dd3f09b277de18ca3e43fc0af20d20c4b3e92ef2a48bd291ccb2
  Current Blockchain Status: Full Node Synced
  ```

17. Optionally Install and run Chia's GUI:

  ```mdx-code-block
  <Tabs
    defaultValue="windows"
    values={[
      {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
      {label: 'Linux/macOS', value: 'nix'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="windows">
  ```
  ```powershell
  (You should be in the <chia-blockchain> folder)

  .\Install-gui.ps1
  cd .\chia-blockchain-gui
  npm run electron
  ```
  ```mdx-code-block
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="nix">
  ```
  ```bash
  (You should be in the <chia-blockchain> folder)
  
  sh install-gui.sh
  cd ./chia-blockchain-gui
  npm run electron &
  ```
  ```mdx-code-block
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
  ```

Once you have a synced full node and some TXCH, you may proceed to the next section. If your requested TXCH has not yet arrived, post your address on the #dev channel on Keybase. Someone might be able to send some to you.

## Note about Chia wallets

In Chia, each public/private key pair can hold multiple wallets of various types.

A "fingerprint" is a 4-byte hash of a public key. The computer running the examples we'll use in the next sections had two public/private key pairs, and thus two fingerprints, labeled `1)` and `2)`.

Note that simultaneous syncing of multiple fingerprints is not possible. Whether you're using the CLI or the GUI (in general, not just for NFTs) you have to select one of the fingerprints to sync, while the other will be temporarily ignored and not synced.

Within each of the fingerprints, you can store multiple wallets of various types. The default wallet is a `Chia Wallet`, aka a `STANDARD_WALLET`. This label is [part of an enum](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/blob/main/chia/wallet/util/wallet_types.py) with a value of `0`. The other wallet types are as follows:

```python
STANDARD_WALLET = 0
RATE_LIMITED = 1
ATOMIC_SWAP = 2
AUTHORIZED_PAYEE = 3
MULTI_SIG = 4
CUSTODY = 5
CAT = 6
RECOVERABLE = 7
DISTRIBUTED_ID = 8
POOLING_WALLET = 9
NFT = 10
```

A few notes about this enum:
* The only types that are supported as of June 2022 are STANDARD_WALLET, CAT, and NFT.
* Each fingerprint/Wallet Key can only hold one `STANDARD_WALLET` and one `NFT` (for now), but it can hold multiple `CAT`s.
* In addition to a type, each wallet also has a `Wallet ID`. This is simply an integer that increments for each new wallet.

For example, the following setup would be possible to run on a single computer:

* Wallet Key 1 (not synced)
  * Chia Wallet (Type = STANDARD_WALLET, Wallet ID = 1)
  * Marmot (Type = CAT, Wallet ID = 2)
* Wallet Key 2 (synced)
  * Chia Wallet (Type = STANDARD_WALLET, Wallet ID = 1)
  * NFT Wallet (Type = NFT, Wallet ID = 2)
  * Marmot (Type = CAT, Wallet ID = 3)
  * Spacebucks (Type = CAT, Wallet ID = 4)

---

## Create a DID wallet (CLI)

Before you can mint an NFT, you'll need to create new wallets for your DIDs and NFTs.

1. Run `chia wallet did create -n '<name>' -a 1` to create a DID wallet with a custom name and 1 mojo to start with. Be sure to select your wallet fingerprint that is synced and contains some TXCH:

```powershell
(venv) $ chia wallet did create -n 'test_did_wallet' -a 1
Successfully created a DID wallet with name test_did_wallet and id 2 on key 738684487
Successfully created a DID fa4a2043da967ba1f47d9658595ec4a7c5aceb7460ab75ee4fec123bcd69c6e5 in the newly created DID wallet
```

2. It will take a few minutes for your new wallet to be confirmed on the blockchain. Run `chia wallet show` to view the status. Once your new wallet (`test_did_wallet` in this example) shows up, take note of its `Wallet ID` (`2` in this example).

```powershell
(venv) $ chia wallet show
Wallet height: 1048303
Sync status: Synced
Balances, fingerprint: 738684487

Chia Wallet:
   -Total Balance:         1.0 txch (1000000000000 mojo)
   -Pending Total Balance: 0.999999999999 txch (999999999999 mojo)
   -Spendable:             0.0 txch (0 mojo)
   -Type:                  STANDARD_WALLET
   -Wallet ID:             1

test_did_wallet:
   -Total Balance:         0.0
   -Pending Total Balance: 1.0
   -Spendable:             0.0
   -Type:                  DISTRIBUTED_ID
   -Asset ID:              {"origin_coin": {"parent_coin_info": "0x762117c92a72313e201ffaa5
   -Wallet ID:             2
```

---

## Create an NFT wallet (CLI)

:::tip
You can create an NFT wallet via a CLI command or an RPC. This section will show you the CLI command. If you prefer to use an RPC, skip to the [next section](#create-an-nft-wallet-rpc "Create an NFT wallet (RPC)").
:::

[todo is it possible to tie a DID wallet to the NFT wallet using CLI, or only RPC?]
1. Run `chia wallet nft create` to create a new NFT wallet. Be sure to select your wallet fingerprint that is synced and contains some TXCH:

```powershell
(venv) $ chia wallet nft create
Successfully created an NFT wallet with id 3 on key 738684487
```

2. Run `chia wallet show` to view the status. Take note of your NFT wallet's `Wallet ID` (`3` in this example).

```powershell
(venv) $ chia wallet show
Wallet height: 1048306
Sync status: Synced
Balances, fingerprint: 738684487

Chia Wallet:
   -Total Balance:         0.999999999999 txch (999999999999 mojo)
   -Pending Total Balance: 0.999999999999 txch (999999999999 mojo)
   -Spendable:             0.999999999999 txch (999999999999 mojo)
   -Type:                  STANDARD_WALLET
   -Wallet ID:             1

test_did_wallet:
   -Total Balance:         1.0
   -Pending Total Balance: 1.0
   -Spendable:             1.0
   -Type:                  DISTRIBUTED_ID
   -Asset ID:              {"origin_coin": {"parent_coin_info": "0x762117c92a72313e201ffaa5"}}
   -Wallet ID:             2

NFT Wallet:
   -Total Balance:         0.0
   -Pending Total Balance: 0.0
   -Spendable:             0.0
   -Type:                  NFT
   -Asset ID:              {"my_nft_coins": [], "did_wallet_id": null}
   -Wallet ID:             3
```

:::info
Each NFT wallet can be anchored to either a DID or a public/private key pair. A public/private key pair can only contain a single NFT wallet, which will act as the "inbox" for all NFTs associated with that key pair. It is therefore only possible to have one `NFT Wallet` for each `Wallet key`. However, each DID can contain a single NFT wallet, which allows for the creation of multiple `NFT Wallets` inside the same `Wallet key`.
:::

If you have successfully created an NFT wallet from the CLI command shown above, feel free to skip the next section, which will show you how to create an NFT wallet using an RPC. Instead, head to the following section, [Obtain an image and its hash](#obtain-an-image-and-its-hash "Obtain an image and its hash").


## Create an NFT wallet (RPC)

:::warning important
This section will use **Linux/MacOS** rpc syntax. When running rpc commands on **Windows**, you will need to escape all quotes with backslashes.
  
For example, here is a typical rpc command on **Linux** and **MacOS**:
```powershell
chia rpc wallet create_new_wallet '{"wallet_type": "nft_wallet"}'
```

To run the same command on **Windows**, you will need to escape the quotes, so it looks like this:
```powershell  
chia rpc wallet create_new_wallet '{\"wallet_type\": \"nft_wallet\"}'
```
:::
  
:::info
If you already created an NFT wallet using the CLI command from the previous section, you can skip to the next section, [Obtain an image and its hash](#obtain-an-image-and-its-hash "Obtain an image and its hash").
:::

1. Create an NFT wallet that references your DID wallet's `Wallet ID`. Be sure to change the `did_wallet_id` to your local DID wallet's `Wallet ID`:

```powershell
(venv) PS C:\Users\User\Chia\main_dids\chia-blockchain> chia rpc wallet create_new_wallet '{\"wallet_type\": \"nft_wallet\", \"did_wallet_id\": 2}'
{
    "success": true,
    "type": 10,
    "wallet_id": 3
}
```
Note that a wall with a `type` of `10` is an NFT wallet.

2. Run `chia wallet show` to view the status. The NFT wallet has a `Wallet ID` of `2`:

```powershell
(venv) $ chia wallet show
Wallet height: 1048306
Sync status: Synced
Balances, fingerprint: 738684487

Chia Wallet:
   -Total Balance:         0.999999999999 txch (999999999999 mojo)
   -Pending Total Balance: 0.999999999999 txch (999999999999 mojo)
   -Spendable:             0.999999999999 txch (999999999999 mojo)
   -Type:                  STANDARD_WALLET
   -Wallet ID:             1

test_did_wallet:
   -Total Balance:         1.0
   -Pending Total Balance: 1.0
   -Spendable:             1.0
   -Type:                  DISTRIBUTED_ID
   -Asset ID:              {"origin_coin": {"parent_coin_info": "0x762117c92a72313e201ffaa5"}}
   -Wallet ID:             2

NFT Wallet:
   -Total Balance:         0.0
   -Pending Total Balance: 0.0
   -Spendable:             0.0
   -Type:                  NFT
   -Asset ID:              {"my_nft_coins": [], "did_wallet_id": null}
   -Wallet ID:             3
```

## Obtain an image and its hash

1. First, find an image to mint as an NFT. For this example, we'll use an image that is licensed in the public domain:
[https://images.pexels.com/photos/11053072/pexels-photo-11053072.jpeg](https://images.pexels.com/photos/11053072/pexels-photo-11053072.jpeg)

2. Calculate the image's hash. Here are three (of many) options:
    
  i. Curl with sha256sum. If you're on Windows, you'll need to run this command from git bash
  ```powershell
  $ curl https://images.pexels.com/photos/11053072/pexels-photo-11053072.jpeg | sha256sum
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  100 3252k  100 3252k    0     0  19.8M      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 19.9M

  ```

  ii. Curl with shasum. If you're on Windows, you'll need to run this command from git bash
  ```powershell
  $ curl https://images.pexels.com/photos/11053072/pexels-photo-11053072.jpeg | shasum -a 256

## Mint an NFT (RPC)

1. Mint your NFT using the following values:
  * `wallet_id`: The ID of your NFT wallet
  * `uris`: A comma-separated list of URIs where this image may be found. We'll only use one URI for this example. For NFT1, the image at this uri will be displayed in Chia's GUI wallet. Be sure to add two backslashes (`\\`) to escape any special characters in the URI, such as `?` and `=`
  * `hash`: The hash you just calculated. For now, the minting tool and wallet will not verify that this hash is correct. Be sure to double-check this, ideally using multiple methods to calculate the hash. Hash verification will be included in NFT1
  * `artist_percentage`: For NFT1, this will be the royalty that will go to the original artist each time the NFT is sold. The royalty percentage is represented by an unsigned int with the three least significant digits representing values past the decimal point. For example, a royalty of 1575 would equal 1.575%. **However, this feature is disabled in NFT0**
  * `artist_address`: Enter the wallet address of the original artist. For this example on testnet, we'll use a local address

The command will end up looking like this:

```powershell
(venv) $ chia rpc wallet nft_mint_nft '{"wallet_id": 2, "uris": ["https://images.pexels.com/photos/11053072/pexels-photo-11053072.jpeg"], "hash": "14836b86a48e1b2b5e857213af97534704475b4c155d34b2cb83ed4b7cba2bb0", "artist_percentage": 1500, "artist_address": "txch1m4fshsg2cas5lmzh8x6n50mhcs2fehc3tucundczp0kk2z7t3cxsgj65pu"}'
```

If successful, you will receive a JSON output, including the coin additions and removals involved in minting the NFT, as well as the spend bundle that was used. At the end of the output, you should see `"success": true,`.

```powershell
(venv) $ chia rpc wallet nft_mint_nft '{"wallet_id": 2, "uris": ["https://images.pexels.com/photos/11053072/pexels-photo-11053072.jpeg"], "hash": "14836b86a48e1b2b5e857213af97534704475b4c155d34b2cb83ed4b7cba2bb0", "artist_percentage": 1500, "artist_address": "txch1m4fshsg2cas5lmzh8x6n50mhcs2fehc3tucundczp0kk2z7t3cxsgj65pu"}'

        }
    ],
    "success": true,
    "wallet_id": 2
}
```

2. Wait a few minutes for your NFT to be confirmed on the blockchain. To view your NFT, run the `nft_get_nfts` RPC, passing in your NFT wallet's ID. Eventually, the NFT will show up:

```powershell
(venv) $ chia rpc wallet nft_get_nfts '{"wallet_id": 2}'
{
    "nft_list": [
        {
            "data_hash": "14836B86A48E1B2B5E857213AF97534704475B4C155D34B2CB83ED4B7CBA2BB0",

            "royalty": 0,
            "version": "NFT0"
        }

}
```

## Transfer an NFT (RPC)

This section will show you how to transfer an NFT from one TXCH wallet to another.

:::important
Before you can run this example, you'll need a second NFT wallet. One way to accomplish this would be to follow this guide on another computer. If you want to use the same computer, you'll need to generate another set of keys and create another NFT wallet. This can be accomplished by doing the following:
* Run `chia keys generate` to generate a new key
* Run `chia keys show` and copy the `First wallet address:` of the new key
* Run `chia wallet show` and sync the new wallet key
* Run `chia wallet nft create` to create a new NFT wallet with the new key
* Run `chia wallet show` and sync the wallet key that contains the NFT
:::

Before continuing, be sure that you have a synced wallet that contains an NFT to transfer, as well as another wallet that will receive the NFT.

1. Run the `nft_transfer_nft` RPC using the following values:
  * `wallet_id`: The `Wallet ID` of the NFT to transfer
  * `target_address`: The address of the NFT wallet to transfer to
  * `nft_coin_id`: The ID of the NFT coin, obtained from the `nft_get_nfts` RPC

If successful, the target address, coin id, and spend bundle will all be displayed. For example:

```powershell
(venv) $ chia rpc wallet nft_transfer_nft '{"wallet_id": 2, "target_address": "txch167lgv3v86m6vzyr9s44w2xwsnuxcdvsw2lvsf7ru03cq6p7xyngs7mvju7", "nft_coin_id": "4296D4E49E2056DB5AEB62DF849851E61326DAEA4337825BE15410E7F4C07E32"}'

2. Sync the wallet you just transferred the NFT to (whether it's on the same machine or a different one). After syncing is complete, run the `nft_get_nfts` rpc again to view the NFT in its new location:

```powershell
(venv) $ chia rpc wallet nft_get_nfts '{"wallet_id": 2}'
{

## Add a URI to an NFT (RPC)
This section will show you how to add a new data URI to your NFT. Remember, NFTs contain a list of URIs. The current owner may add URIs as needed, but they may not be removed. This helps to obtain digital permanence while decreasing the likelihood of fraud from changing URIs.

1. Run the `nft_add_uri` RPC using the following values:
