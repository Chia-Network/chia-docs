## New Proof Format

In 2024 we announced that we were developing a new Proof of Space format. This is a long-term project which is not expected to be finalized until the end of 2026. All farmers will need to replot in the year leading up to that date. This will be a gradual process, so farmers will have plenty of time to plan ahead.
