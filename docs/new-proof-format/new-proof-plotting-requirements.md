## Plot Sizes

The new proof of space format supports plots as small as 1.6 GiB. Due to symmetric properties of the format, only even-sized k-sizes are supported. While we currently have no plans to support sizes smaller than k28, larger k-sizes may be enabled in the future.

:::note
Subject to change pending final parameters.
:::

| Plot Size | All RAM        |
| :-------- | :------------- |
| k32       | &#126;10.6 GiB |
| k30       | &#126;4.2 GiB  |
| k28       | &#126;1.6 GiB  |

## Plotting Performance and Requirements

CPU plotting will be possible but will be less efficient than GPU. All times shown are for all-RAM plotting, although farmers can trade cpu RAM for temporary SSD storage, which results in slightly slower performance.

:::note
Pending Plot ID Filter and Plot Difficulty settings. Aim will be for 3060 to plot >20TiB/day
