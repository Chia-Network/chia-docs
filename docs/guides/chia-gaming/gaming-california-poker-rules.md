## Objective

California Poker is a card game where players exchange cards and compete to make the best five-card poker hand. Each player receives 8 cards with all 16 cards visible to both players, selects 4 to swap with the other player, and keeps the other 4. The player who can make the best five-card poker hand from their 8 cards after swapping wins.

## Setup

- Each player receives 8 cards, all shown face up
- Cards are displayed sorted in rank order

## Gameplay

### Card Selection Phase

1. Both players view their 8 cards simultaneously and can see their opponents cards
2. Each player selects 4 cards to keep
3. The 4 cards not selected are automatically swapped with the opponent
4. Players wait for their opponent to complete their selection

### Hand Evaluation

After cards swap:

- Each player now has 8 cards (4 they kept + 4 received from opponent)
- Each player constructs the best possible five-card poker hand from their 8 cards
- Standard poker hand rankings apply (see Hand Rankings below)

### Determining the Winner

The player with the highest-ranking five-card poker hand wins the hand.

## Hand Rankings

From highest to lowest:

1. **Royal Flush**: A, K, Q, J, 10, all of the same suit
2. **Straight Flush**: Five consecutive cards of the same suit
3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank
4. **Full House**: Three cards of the same rank plus two other cards of the same rank
5. **Flush**: Five cards of the same suit (not in sequence)
6. **Straight**: Five consecutive cards of different suits
7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank
8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs of same rank cards
9. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank
10. **High Card**: When no other hand is made, the highest card wins

## Game Flow

1. **Cards Shown**: Both players view their 8 cards
2. **Card Selection**: Each player picks 4 cards to swap
3. **Wait for Opponent**: Wait for opponent to complete selection (may be skipped if opponent finishes first)
