## 1. Company Background

**Chia Network Inc.** is a software company founded in 2017 by Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent. Our mission is to build a global, public, and open-source platform that enables secure and transparent financial transactions. As a leader in the blockchain space, Chia is developing a new, more sustainable, and powerful blockchain technology. This gaming project is a critical proof of concept to validate state channel primitives, which will directly inform the development of payment channels and other financial applications for the Chia ecosystem.

## 2. Project Overview and Partner's Role

Chia Network Inc is seeking a partner to take over the development, product management, and hosting of its gaming solution. The goal is to transition the project from a proof of concept to a fully managed, revenue-generating product for the partner. The partner's responsibilities will be to manage the platform as a complete product, including operations, ongoing development, and business strategy to grow the user base and generate revenue long-term.

## 3. Scope of Work (SOW)

The partner will assume full responsibility for the project following the completion of the v1 build. The initial scope of work will be to:

- **Platform Maintenance:** Provide continuous bug fixes, game support, and ongoing maintenance for the platform.

- **Product Development:** Revamp the existing UI/UX and build out new gamification features. A minimum requirement is to include player profiles, leaderboards, and a basic achievement system.

- **Infrastructure Management:** Manage all backend and hosting infrastructure, ensuring platform stability, performance, and security.

- **Blockchain Integration:** Maintain the existing wallet integrations including the logic for state channel setup, winnings, and error handling.

- **Security:** Conduct ongoing API security scanning and vulnerability management.

## 4. Technical Details & Dependencies

The project is an open-source platform built on a modern technical stack. Partners should have expertise with the following:

- **Languages:** Rust (primary backend), TypeScript (frontend), and Chialisp (on-chain logic).
- **Web Technologies:** Frontend development with an emphasis on modern web UI/UX.
- **Blockchain:** Familiarity with blockchain concepts and, ideally, experience with the Chia ecosystem.
- **Security:** Experience with security tools like OWASP ZAP and handling JWT authentication.

:::note Key Expectation

Chia Network's internal team will deliver a fully functional v1 with all core blockchain and state channel logic completed. The partner's role is to build upon and manage this foundation.

The codebase is publicly available at [https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-gaming](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-gaming).

## 5. Partner Timeline and Deliverables

- **Demo Submission:** The top three proposal submissions must submit a demo of their proposed solution by the Demo Submission Deadline.

- **Partner Takeover:** The partner will officially take over the project upon the successful completion of the v1 build. A reasonable estimate for this handover is end of Q1 2026.

- **First 6-12 Months:** The final proposal should include a phased plan outlining deliverables for the initial period, including a schedule for the UI revamp and the release of new gamification features.

## 6. Proposal Submission and Evaluation

### Submission & Contact

- All questions regarding this RFP must be submitted in writing to proposals@chia.net by the Questions Submission Deadline. Responses will be published publicly for all vendors to access by the Questions Response Announcement.

- Proposals must be submitted digitally in PDF format to the same email address by the Proposal Submission Deadline.

- Top three proposals will be determined by Chia Network, Inc for which the submitters will be required to submit a demo of their proposed solutions by the Demo Submission Deadline.

### Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated on a combination of factors, with cost and applicable web2 experience (hosting, UI, gamification) being the most heavily weighted. We are looking for a partner with a proven track record of managing and growing a web-based product.

The top three proposals will be chosen for the next phase which requires potential partners to create and submit demos by the Demo Submission Deadline. The final partner decision will be made by the Partner Decision Announcement.
