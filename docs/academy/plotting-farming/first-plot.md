## Common gotchas

- **Joining a pool before plotting:** It might seem strange to join a pool before setting up your plots, but the plots need to be generated using a plotnft in order for the pool to know who runs them. You must associate a plotnft with a pool if you want to use pooling, and if set up correctly you can always leave the pool later and farm your plots solo.
