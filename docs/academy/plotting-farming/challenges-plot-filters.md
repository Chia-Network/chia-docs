title: Challenges & Plot Filters
slug: /challenges-plot-filters
---

In this lesson, we discuss how the plot filter works, and what the benefits are of using one.

## Learning objectives

- **Plot Filters**: Understand the basics of how the plot filter works, as well as the benefits of using one.
- **Challenge Generation**: Understand how the challenge is generated by the Timelord and sent to the Farmer.

## Script

0:00  
The Timelord generates a new challenge about every 9 seconds. This is then hashed with the ID of each plot.

0:20  
If the hash starts with 9 zeroes, the plot is considered eligible for harvesting. This is called the plot filter. The Plot Filter serves as a decentralizing force to further randomize the winner, as well as reduce the total compute needed for each challenge.

0:40  
When a farmer receives a challenge, the harvester first determines which plots are valid and pass the plot filter, then produces potential proofs of space and submits them to the Timelord for verification and review.

1:00  
The Timelord will choose the Proof of Space that most closely meets the challenge, and using the challenge and provided Proof of Space as inputs, runs a VDF to prove that time has passed and produces the next challenge.

## Common gotchas

- **Are valid proofs filtered out?:** It is very possible that a valid proof of space would be contained in a filtered plot. This affects every farmer equally though, and the benefits of further decentralization are well worth it.

About every 9 seconds

</details>

:::tip Question 2 - Filter Benefits

What are the two significant benefits of using a plot filter?

:::

<details>

<summary> Answer (expand when ready to see the answer)  </summary>

1. It further decentralizes the network.
2. It reduces the amount of compute needed, improving network efficiency
