title: Logging Reference
slug: /troubleshooting/logging-reference

Chia blockchain nodes consist of several components that each handle different aspects of farming, harvesting, the wallet and general management of a node. Each component creates entries in a single log file `debug.log`.

## Log file Location:

| OS      | Location                                                                           |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux   | `~/.chia/mainnet/log/debug.log`                                                    |
| Windows | `%systemdrive% %homepath% \.chia\mainnet\debug.log` (`C:\Users\<username>\.chia…`) |
| MacOS   | `/Users/<username>/.chia/mainnet/log/debug.log`                                    |

## Log File Management:

By default, Chia allows debug.log to grow to 20MB, and then rotates the file by closing debug.log, renaming it to debug.log.1, and renames any existing older log files to debug.log.x, to a maximum of 7 old log files. If a log rotation is required and all 7 old log files exist, the oldest log file is overwritten with the next earliest file; resulting in a maximum of 160MB of the most recent messages being stored.

## Log Detail Level:

Chia is shipped with the debug.log only containing messages at the WARN or ERROR level. Many of the messages needed to fully monitor a node are only visible at the INFO level. Changes to the logging level can be done in the `config.yaml` file in the `mainnet/config` folder.

## Change the Log Level Output:

You are looking for the first reference to logging in the file that looks like this:

```
farmer:
  logging: &id001
    log_filename: log/debug.log
    log_level: WARN
    log_stdout: false
```

Change the `log_level` to `INFO`, save the file, and restart the node.

## Node Components:

| Component        | Function                                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| farmer_server    | Signage stuff about signs and things            |
| harvester_server | Gathers and shares plot information             |
| timelord_server  | Manages Verifiable Delay Functions for the node |
| wallet_server    | Controls wallet functions                       |
| full_node_server | This component manages the node                 |

## Log Message Format:

| Field             | Content                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Date/time         | in ISO format, in local timezone |
| Node Component    | see the list above               |
| Log Level         | ERROR, WARN, INFO                |
| Directional Arrow |                                  |
| Message           | see below                        |

## Log Messages Confirming Node Health:

```
09:55:43.847 harvester src.harvester.harvester : INFO     1 plots were eligible for farming 2d8b1c58a0... Found 0 proofs. Time: 0.13772 s. Total 100 plots
09:55:52.737 harvester src.harvester.harvester : INFO     3 plots were eligible for farming 2d8b1c58a0... Found 0 proofs. Time: 0.43679 s. Total 100 plots
09:56:01.646 harvester src.harvester.harvester : INFO     2 plots were eligible for farming 2d8b1c58a0... Found 0 proofs. Time: 0.14055 s. Total 100 plots
```

`x plots were eligible for farming` – This message from the harvester shows how the node responds to challenges. The `x` value shows how many plots passed the initial filter, [more on filters here](/faq#what-is-the-plot-filter-and-why-didnt-my-plot-pass-it).

- The block prefix is shown, and the `Found y proofs.` The `y` value shows how many plots were accepted as proofs, and usually the value is zero. Most of the time if there is a proof you win, but not always as described in the [FAQ page](/faq#is-it-possible-to-have-a-proof-but-not-get-a-reward).
- Next is `Time: x.xxx s` which shows how long the node took to respond to the challenge. A recommended response time is less than 5 seconds. If this value is greater than 3 seconds a warning will be displayed in the GUI.
- Finally `Total x plots` shows the number of plots recognized by the node. If this doesn't look right [check your plots are valid](/faq#how-do-i-know-if-my-plots-are-ok).

Another log message you will see is `Updated Wallet peak to height x, weight y` - This message is from the `wallet_blockchain` component. Value `x` is the current height of the blockchain and should match the Height shown in the `chia show -s` command. This indicates that the node wallet is fully synced with the network. If that is not the case [check here for a common solution](/faq#why-is-my-wallet-not-synced-why-can-i-not-connect-to-wallet-from-the-gui).
